service code of ethicspollution is the introduction of harmful materials into the environment. these harmful materials are called pollutants. grades subjectsbiology ecology health earth science geographycontents imagespollution is the introduction of harmful materials into the environment. these harmful materials are called pollutants. pollutants can be natural such as volcanic ash. they can also be created by human activity such as trash or runoff produced by factories. pollutants damage the quality of air water and land. many things that are useful to people produce pollution. cars spew pollutants from their exhaust pipes. burning coal to create electricity pollutes the air. industries and homes generate garbage and sewage that can pollute the land and water. pesticideschemical poisons used to kill weeds and insectsseep into waterways and harm wildlife. all living thingsfrom one celled microbes to blue whalesdepend on earth s supply of air and water. when these resources are polluted all forms of life are threatened. pollution is a global problem. although urban areas are usually more polluted than the countryside pollution can spread to remote places where no people live. for example pesticides and other chemicals have been found in the antarctic ice sheet. in the middle of the northern pacific ocean a huge collection of microscopic plastic particles forms what is known as the great pacific garbage patch. air and water currents carry pollution. ocean currents and migrating fish carry marine pollutants far and wide. winds can pick up radioactive material accidentally released from a nuclear reactor and scatter it around the world. smoke from a factory in one country drifts into another country. in the past visitors to big bend national park in the u. s. state of texas could see kilometers across the vast landscape. now coal burning power plants in texas and the neighboring state of chihuahua mexico have spewed so much pollution into the air that visitors to big bend can sometimes see only kilometers. the three major types of pollution are air pollution water pollution and land pollution. air pollutionsometimes air pollution is visible. a person can see dark smoke pour from the exhaust pipes of large trucks or factories for example. more often however air pollution is invisible. polluted air can be dangerous even if the pollutants are invisible. it can make people s eyes burn and make them have difficulty breathing. it can also increase the risk of lung cancer. sometimes air pollution kills quickly. in an accident at a pesticide plant in bhopal india released a deadly gas into the air. at least people died within days. hundreds of thousands more were permanently injured. natural disasters can also cause air pollution to increase quickly. when volcanoes erupt they eject volcanic ash and gases into the atmosphere. volcanic ash can discolor the sky for months. after the eruption of the indonesian volcano of krakatoa in ash darkened the sky around the world. the dimmer sky caused fewer crops to be harvested as far away as europe and north america. for years meteorologists tracked what was known as the equatorial smoke stream. in fact this smoke stream was a jet stream a wind high in earth s atmosphere that krakatoa s air pollution made visible. volcanic gases such as sulfur dioxide can kill nearby residents and make the soil infertile for years. mount vesuvius a volcano in italy famously erupted in killing hundreds of residents of the nearby towns of pompeii and herculaneum. most victims of vesuvius were not killed by lava or landslides caused by the eruption. they were choked or asphyxiated by deadly volcanic gases. in a toxic cloud developed over lake nyos cameroon. lake nyos sits in the crater of a volcano. though the volcano did not erupt it did eject volcanic gases into the lake. the heated gases passed through the water of the lake and collected as a cloud that descended the slopes of the volcano and into nearby valleys. as the toxic cloud moved across the landscape it killed birds and other organisms in their natural habitat. this air pollution also killed thousands of cattle and as many as people. most air pollution is not natural however. it comes from burning fossil fuelscoal oil and natural gas. when gasoline is burned to power cars and trucks it produces carbon monoxide a colorless odorless gas. the gas is harmful in high concentrations or amounts. city traffic produces highly concentrated carbon monoxide. cars and factories produce other common pollutants including nitrogen oxide sulfur dioxide and hydrocarbons. these chemicals react with sunlight to produce smog a thick fog or haze of air pollution. the smog is so thick in linfen china that people can seldom see the sun. smog can be brown or grayish blue depending on which pollutants are in it. smog makes breathing difficult especially for children and older adults. some cities that suffer from extreme smog issue air pollution warnings. the government of hong kong for example will warn people not to go outside or engage in strenuous physical activity when smog is very thick. when air pollutants such as nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide mix with moisture they change into acids. they then fall back to earth as acid rain. wind often carries acid rain far from the pollution source. pollutants produced by factories and power plants in spain can fall as acid rain in norway. acid rain can kill all the trees in a forest. it can also devastate lakes streams and other waterways. when lakes become acidic fish can t survive. in sweden acid rain created thousands of dead lakes where fish no longer live. acid rain also wears away marble and other kinds of stone. it has erased the words on gravestones and damaged many historic buildings and monuments. the taj mahal in agra india was once gleaming white. years of exposure to acid rain has left it pale. governments have tried to prevent acid rain by limiting the amount of pollutants released into the air. in europe and north america they have had some success but acid rain remains a major problem in the developing world especially asia. greenhouse gases are another source of air pollution. greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane occur naturally in the atmosphere. in fact they are necessary for life on earth. they absorb sunlight reflected from earth preventing it from escaping into space. by trapping heat in the atmosphere they keep earth warm enough for people to live. this is called the greenhouse effect. but human activities such as burning fossil fuels and destroying forests have increased the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. this has increased the greenhouse effect and average temperatures across the globe are rising. the decade that began in the year was the warmest on record. this increase in worldwide average temperatures caused in part by human activity is called global warming. global warming is causing ice sheets and glaciers to melt. the melting ice is causing sea levels to rise at a rate of millimeters per year. the rising seas will eventually flood low lying coastal regions. entire nations such as the islands of maldives are threatened by this climate change. global warming also contributes to the phenomenon of ocean acidification. ocean acidification is the process of ocean waters absorbing more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. fewer organisms can survive in warmer less salty waters. the ocean food web is threatened as plants and animals such as coral fail to adapt to more acidic oceans. scientists have predicted that global warming will cause an increase in severe storms. it will also cause more droughts in some regions and more flooding in others. the change in average temperatures is already shrinking some habitats the regions where plants and animals naturally live. polar bears hunt seals from sea ice in the arctic. the melting ice is forcing polar bears to travel farther to find food and their numbers are shrinking. people and governments can respond quickly and effectively to reduce air pollution. chemicals called chlorofluorocarbons are a dangerous form of air pollution that governments worked to reduce in the s and s. cfcs are found in gases that cool refrigerators in foam products and in aerosol cans. cfcs damage the ozone layer a region in earth s upper atmosphere. the ozone layer protects earth by absorbing much of the sun s harmful ultraviolet radiation. when people are exposed to more ultraviolet radiation they are more likely to develop skin cancer eye diseases and other illnesses. in the s scientists noticed that the ozone layer over antarctica was thinning. this is often called the ozone hole. no one lives permanently in antarctica. but australia the home of more than million people lies at the edge of the hole. in the s the australian government began an effort to warn people of the dangers of too much sun. many countries including the united states now severely limit the production of cfcs. water pollutionsome polluted water looks muddy smells bad and has garbage floating in it. some polluted water looks clean but is filled with harmful chemicals you can t see or smell. polluted water is unsafe for drinking and swimming. some people who drink polluted water are exposed to hazardous chemicals that may make them sick years later. others consume bacteria and other tiny aquatic organisms that cause disease. the united nations estimates that children die every day from drinking dirty water. sometimes polluted water harms people indirectly. they get sick because the fish that live in polluted water are unsafe to eat. they have too many pollutants in their flesh. there are some natural sources of water pollution. oil and natural gas for example can leak into oceans and lakes from natural underground sources. these sites are called petroleum seeps. the world s largest petroleum seep is the coal oil point seep off the coast of the u. s. state of california. the coal oil point seep releases so much oil that tar balls wash up on nearby beaches. tar balls are small sticky pieces of pollution that eventually decompose in the ocean. human activity also contributes to water pollution. chemicals and oils from factories are sometimes dumped or seep into waterways. these chemicals are called runoff. chemicals in runoff can create a toxic environment for aquatic life. runoff can also help create a fertile environment for cyanobacteria also called blue green algae. cyanobacteria reproduce rapidly creating a harmful algal bloom. harmful algal blooms prevent organisms such as plants and fish from living in the ocean. they are associated with dead zones in the world s lakes and rivers places where little life exists below surface water. mining and drilling can also contribute to water pollution. acid mine drainage is a major contributor to pollution of rivers and streams near coal mines. acid helps miners remove coal from the surrounding rocks. the acid is washed into streams and rivers where it reacts with rocks and sand. it releases chemical sulfur from the rocks and sand creating a river rich in sulfuric acid. sulfuric acid is toxic to plants fish and other aquatic organisms. sulfuric acid is also toxic to people making rivers polluted by amd dangerous sources of water for drinking and hygiene. oil spills are another source of water pollution. in april the deepwater horizon oil rig exploded in the gulf of mexico causing oil to gush from the ocean floor. in the following months hundreds of millions of gallons of oil spewed into the gulf waters. the spill produced large plumes of oil under the sea and an oil slick on the surface as large as square kilometers. the oil slick coated wetlands in the u. s. states of louisiana and mississippi killing marsh plants and aquatic organisms such as crabs and fish. birds such as pelicans became coated in oil and were unable to fly or access food. more than million animals died as a result of the deepwater horizon oil spill. buried chemical waste can also pollute water supplies. for many years people disposed of chemical wastes carelessly not realizing its dangers. in the s people living in the love canal area in niagara falls new york suffered from extremely high rates of cancer and birth defects. it was discovered that a chemical waste dump had poisoned the area s water. in families living in love canal had to abandon their homes. if not disposed of properly radioactive waste from nuclear power plants can escape into the environment. radioactive waste can harm living things and pollute the water. sewage that has not been properly treated is a common source of water pollution. many cities around the world have poor sewage systems and sewage treatment plants. delhi the capital of india is home to more than million people. more than half the sewage and other waste produced in the city are dumped into the yamuna river. this pollution makes the river dangerous to use as a source of water for drinking or hygiene. it also reduces the river s fishery resulting in less food for the local community. a major source of water pollution is fertilizer used in agriculture. fertilizer is material added to soil to make plants grow larger and faster. fertilizers usually contain large amounts of the elements nitrogen and phosphorus which help plants grow. rainwater washes fertilizer into streams and lakes. there the nitrogen and phosphorus cause cyanobacteria to form harmful algal blooms. rain washes other pollutants into streams and lakes. it picks up animal waste from cattle ranches. cars drip oil onto the street and rain carries it into storm drains which lead to waterways such as rivers and seas. rain sometimes washes chemical pesticides off of plants and into streams. pesticides can also seep into groundwater the water beneath the surface of the earth. heat can pollute water. power plants for example produce a huge amount of heat. power plants are often located on rivers so they can use the water as a coolant. cool water circulates through the plant absorbing heat. the heated water is then returned to the river. aquatic creatures are sensitive to changes in temperature. some fish for example can only live in cold water. warmer river temperatures prevent fish eggs from hatching. warmer river water also contributes to harmful algal blooms. another type of water pollution is simple garbage. the citarum river in indonesia for example has so much garbage floating in it that you can not see the water. floating trash makes the river difficult to fish in. aquatic animals such as fish and turtles mistake trash such as plastic bags for food. plastic bags and twine can kill many ocean creatures. chemical pollutants in trash can also pollute the water making it toxic for fish and people who use the river as a source of drinking water. the fish that are caught in a polluted river often have high levels of chemical toxins in their flesh. people absorb these toxins as they eat the fish. garbage also fouls the ocean. many plastic bottles and other pieces of trash are thrown overboard from boats. the wind blows trash out to sea. ocean currents carry plastics and other floating trash to certain places on the globe where it can not escape. the largest of these areas called the great pacific garbage patch is in a remote part of the pacific ocean. according to some estimates this garbage patch is the size of texas. the trash is a threat to fish and seabirds which mistake the plastic for food. many of the plastics are covered with chemical pollutants. land pollutionmany of the same pollutants that foul the water also harm the land. mining sometimes leaves the soil contaminated with dangerous chemicals. pesticides and fertilizers from agricultural fields are blown by the wind. they can harm plants animals and sometimes people. some fruits and vegetables absorb the pesticides that help them grow. when people consume the fruits and vegetables the pesticides enter their bodies. some pesticides can cause cancer and other diseases. a pesticide called ddt was once commonly used to kill insects especially mosquitoes. in many parts of the world mosquitoes carry a disease called malaria which kills a million people every year. swiss chemist paul hermann muller was awarded the nobel prize for his understanding of how ddt can control insects and other pests. ddt is responsible for reducing malaria in places such as taiwan and sri lanka. in american biologist rachel carson wrote a book called silent spring which discussed the dangers of ddt. she argued that it could contribute to cancer in humans. she also explained how it was destroying bird eggs which caused the number of bald eagles brown pelicans and ospreys to drop. in the united states banned the use of ddt. many other countries also banned it. but ddt didn t disappear entirely. today many governments support the use of ddt because it remains the most effective way to combat malaria. trash is another form of land pollution. around the world paper cans glass jars plastic products and junked cars and appliances mar the landscape. litter makes it difficult for plants and other producers in the food web to create nutrients. animals can die if they mistakenly eat plastic. garbage often contains dangerous pollutants such as oils chemicals and ink. these pollutants can leech into the soil and harm plants animals and people. inefficient garbage collection systems contribute to land pollution. often the garbage is picked up and brought to a dump or landfill. garbage is buried in landfills. sometimes communities produce so much garbage that their landfills are filling up. they are running out of places to dump their trash. a massive landfill near quezon city philippines was the site of a land pollution tragedy in. hundreds of people lived on the slopes of the quezon city landfill. these people made their living from recycling and selling items found in the landfill. however the landfill was not secure. heavy rains caused a trash landslide killing people. sometimes landfills are not completely sealed off from the land around them. pollutants from the landfill leak into the earth in which they are buried. plants that grow in the earth may be contaminated and the herbivores that eat the plants also become contaminated. so do the predators that consume the herbivores. this process where a chemical builds up in each level of the food web is called bioaccumulation. pollutants leaked from landfills also leak into local groundwater supplies. there the aquatic food web can suffer from bioaccumulation of toxic chemicals. some communities do not have adequate garbage collection systems and trash lines the side of roads. in other places garbage washes up on beaches. kamilo beach in the u. s. state of hawaii is littered with plastic bags and bottles carried in by the tide. the trash is dangerous to ocean life and reduces economic activity in the area. tourism is hawaii s largest industry. polluted beaches discourage tourists from investing in the area s hotels restaurants and recreational activities. some cities incinerate or burn their garbage. incinerating trash gets rid of it but it can release dangerous heavy metals and chemicals into the air. so while trash incinerators can help with the problem of land pollution they sometimes add to the problem of air pollution. reducing pollutionaround the world people and governments are making efforts to combat pollution. recycling for instance is becoming more common. in recycling trash is processed so its useful materials can be used again. glass aluminum cans and many types of plastic can be melted and reused. paper can be broken down and turned into new paper. recycling reduces the amount of garbage that ends up in landfills incinerators and waterways. austria and switzerland have the highest recycling rates. these nations recycle between and percent of their garbage. the united states recycles about percent of its garbage. governments can combat pollution by passing laws that limit the amount and types of chemicals factories and agribusinesses are allowed to use. the smoke from coal burning power plants can be filtered. people and businesses that illegally dump pollutants into the land water and air can be fined for millions of dollars. some government programs such as the superfund program in the united states can force polluters to clean up the sites they polluted. international agreements can also reduce pollution. the kyoto protocol a united nations agreement to limit the emission of greenhouse gases has been signed by countries. the united states the world s second largest producer of greenhouse gases did not sign the agreement. other countries such as china the world s largest producer of greenhouse gases have not met their goals. still many gains have been made. in the cuyahoga river in the u. s. state of ohio was so clogged with oil and trash that it caught on fire. the fire helped spur the clean water act of. this law limited what pollutants could be released into water and set standards for how clean water should be. today the cuyahoga river is much cleaner. fish have returned to regions of the river where they once could not survive. but even as some rivers are becoming cleaner others are becoming more polluted. as countries around the world become wealthier some forms of pollution increase. countries with growing economies usually need more power plants which produce more pollutants. reducing pollution requires environmental political and economic leadership. developed nations must work to reduce and recycle their materials while developing nations must work to strengthen their economies without destroying the environment. developed and developing countries must work together toward the common goal of protecting the environment for future use. photograph by dennis finleylight pollutionlight pollution is the excess amount of light in the night sky. light pollution also called photopollution is almost always found in urban areas. light pollution can disrupt ecosystems by confusing the distinction between night and day. nocturnal animals those that are active at night may venture out during the day while diurnal animals which are active during daylight hours may remain active well into the night. feeding and sleep patterns may be confused. light pollution also indicates an excess use of energy. the dark sky movement is a campaign by people to reduce light pollution. this would reduce energy use allow ecosystems to function more normally and allow scientists and stargazers to observe the atmosphere. noise pollutionnoise pollution is the constant presence of loud disruptive noises in an area. usually noise pollution is caused by construction or nearby transportation facilities such as airports. noise pollution is unpleasant and can be dangerous. some songbirds such as robins are unable to communicate or find food in the presence of heavy noise pollution. the sound waves produced by some noise pollutants can disrupt the sonar used by marine animals to communicate or locate food. how long does it last different

management of water and sanitation for all. according to the united nations one in three people live without sanitation. a lack of sanitation and sanitary waste management systems can reduce a communitys access to clean water and lack of access to clean water can allow diseases to run rampant sometimes creating epidemics of water borne infectious agents. learning about how freshwater systems work in the wilderness rural communities and urban centers can help us better understand the challenges of providing clean water and sanitation to people around the world. humans impact the physical environment in many ways overpopulation pollution burning fossil fuels and deforestation. changes like these have triggered climate change soil erosion poor air quality and undrinkable water. these negative impacts can affect human behavior and can prompt mass migrations or battles over clean water. help your students understand the impact humans have on the physical environment with these classroom resources. plastic is ubiquitous in our everyday lives. some plastics we can reuse or recycleand many play important roles in areas like medicine and public safetybut other items such as straws are designed for only one use. in fact more than percent of plastic is used only once before it is thrown away where it lingers in the environment for a long long time. it often breaks down into smaller and smaller particles called microplastics which can be ingested by both animals and people. fortunately there are things we can do to helplike stop using plastic bags straws and bottles recycling when we can and disposing of waste properly. use these classroom resources to teach about ocean plastics and check back for more coming later this year for the purposes of regulation the united states environmental protection agency identifies two broad categories of pollution point source pollution and nonpoint source pollution. encyclopedic entry. air pollution consists of chemicals or particles in the air that can harm the health of humans animals and plants. it also damages buildings. watch this brief video picture of practice that captures everyday classroom life and provides

environment for a long long time. it often breaks down into smaller and smaller particles called microplastics which can be ingested by both animals and people. fortunately there are things we can do to helplike stop using plastic bags straws and bottles recycling when we can and disposing of waste properly. use these classroom resources to teach about ocean plastics and check back for more coming later this year for the purposes of regulation the united states environmental protection agency identifies two broad categories of pollution point source pollution and nonpoint source pollution. encyclopedic entry. air pollution consists of chemicals or particles in the air that can harm the health of humans animals and plants. it also damages buildings. watch this brief video picture of practice that captures everyday classroom life and provides real life examples of how students learn and think about freshwater topics. national geographic headquarters street nw washington dc national geographic society is a organization. national geographic society. all rights reserved. privacy notice sustainability policy terms of service code of ethicsbyalina bradford live science contributor t zplanet earth pollution is the process of making land water air or other parts of the environment dirty and not safe or suitable to use. this can be done through the introduction of a contaminant into a natural environment but the contaminant doesnt need to be tangible. things as simple as light sound and temperature can be considered pollutants when introduced artificially into an environment. toxic pollution affects more than million people worldwide according to pure earth a non profit environmental organization. in some of the worlds worst polluted places babies are born with birth defects children have lost to iq points and life expectancy may be as low as years because of cancers and other diseases. read on to find out more about specific types of pollution. land can become polluted by household garbage and by industrial waste. in americans produced about million tons of solid waste according to the u. s. environmental protection agency. a little over half of the waste million tons was gathered in landfills. only about was recycled or composted. organic material was the largest component of the garbage generated the epa said. paper and paperboard accounted for more than food was and yard trimmings were. plastics comprised about of the solid waste while rubber leather and textiles made up. and metals. wood contributed to. of the garbage glass was. and other miscellaneous materials made up about. commercial or industrial waste is a significant portion of solid waste. according to the university of utah industries use million pounds of materials in order to provide the average american family with needed products for one year. much of it is classified as non hazardous such as construction material and medical waste. hazardous waste is any liquid solid or sludge waste that contain properties that are dangerous of potentially harmful to human health or the environment. industries generate hazardous waste from mining petroleum refining pesticide manufacturing and other chemical production. households generate hazardous waste as well including paints and solvents motor oil fluorescent lights aerosol cans and ammunition. water pollution happens when chemicals or dangerous foreign substances are introduced to water including chemicals sewage pesticides and fertilizers from agricultural runoff or metals like lead or mercury. according to the environmental protection agency of assessed stream miles of lakes and of bay and estuarine areas are not clean enough for fishing and swimming. the epa also states that the united states most common contaminants are bacteria mercury phosphorus and nitrogen. these come from the most common sources of contaminates that include agricultural runoff air deposition water diversions and channelization of streams. water pollution isnt just a problem for the united states. according to united nations million people do not have access to clean water and around. billion do not have access to adequate sanitation. adequate sanitation helps to keep sewage and other contaminants from entering the water supply. according to national oceanic and atmospheric administration of pollution in marine environment comes from the land through sources like runoff. water pollution can also severely affect marine life. for example sewage causes pathogens to grow while organic and inorganic compounds in water can change the composition of the precious resource. according to the epa low levels of dissolved oxygen in the water are also considered a pollutant. dissolved is caused by the decomposition of organic materials such as sewage introduced into the water. warming water can also be harmful. the artificial warming of water is called thermal pollution. it can happen when a factory or power plant that is using water to cool its operations ends up discharging hot water. this makes the water hold less oxygen which can kill fish and wildlife. the sudden change of temperature in the body of water can also kill fish. according to the university of georgia it is estimated that around half of the water withdrawn from water systems in the united states each year is used for cooling electric power plants. in nearly all cases of this water is returned to its source where it can raise the water temperature in an area immediately surrounding the water discharge pipe. depending on water flow the water temperature quickly returns to ambient temperatures that do not harm fish. donn dears former president of tsaugust a not for profit corporation organization focused on energy issues told live science. nutrient pollution also called eutrophication is another type of water pollution. it is when nutrients such as nitrogen are added into bodies of water. the nutrient works like fertilizer and makes algae grow at excessive rates according to noaa. the algae blocks light from other plants. the plants die and their decomposition leads to less oxygen in the water. less oxygen in the water kills aquatic animals. the air we breathe has a very exact chemical composition of it is made up of nitrogen oxygen water vapor and inert gases. air pollution occurs when things that arent normally there are added to the air. a common type of air pollution happens when people release particles into the air from burning fuels. this pollution looks like soot containing millions of tiny particles floating in the air. another common type of air pollution is dangerous gases such as sulfur dioxide carbon monoxide nitrogen oxides and chemical vapors. these can take part in further chemical reactions once they are in the atmosphere creating acid rain and smog. other sources of air pollution can come from within buildings such as secondhand smoke. finally air pollution can take the form of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide or sulfur dioxide which are warming the planet through the greenhouse effect. according to the epa the greenhouse effect is when gases absorb the infrared radiation that is released from the earth preventing the heat from escaping. this is a natural process that keeps our atmosphere warm. if too many gases are introduced into the atmosphere though more heat is trapped and this can make the planet artificially warm according to columbia university. air pollution kills more than million people each year according to a study published in the journal of environmental research letters. the effects of air pollution on human health can vary widely depending on the pollutant according to hugh sealy professor and director of the environmental and occupational health track at the department of public health and preventive medicine st. georges university st. georges grenada. if the pollutant is highly toxic the effects on health can be widespread and severe. for example the release of methyl isocyanate gas at union carbide plant in bhopal in killed over people and over suffered respiratory problems. an irritant may cause respiratory illnesses cardiovascular disease and increases in asthma. the very young the old and those with vulnerable immune systems are most at risk from air pollution. the air pollutant may be carcinogenic or biologically active or radioactive. other air pollutants like carbon dioxide have an indirect impact on human health through climate change sealy told live science. even though humans cant see or smell noise pollution it still affects the environment. noise pollution happens when the sound coming from planes industry or other sources reaches harmful levels. research has shown that there are direct links between noise and health including stress related illnesses high blood pressure speech interference hearing loss. for example a study bythe who noise environmental burden on disease working group found that noise pollution may contribute to hundreds of thousands of deaths per year by increasing the rates of coronary heart disease. under the clean air act the epa can regulate machine and plane noise. underwater noise pollution coming from ships has been shown to upset whales navigation systems and kill other species that depend on the natural underwater world. noise also makes wild species communicate louder which can shorten their lifespan. most people cant imagine living without the modern convenience of electric lights. for the natural world though lights have changed the way that days and nights work. some consequences of light pollution are turning on so many lights may not be necessary. research published by international journal of science and research estimates that over illumination wastes about million barrels of oil per day and lighting is responsible for one fourth of all energy consumption worldwide. additional resourcesget breaking science

human induced factors like industrialization deforestation inefficient waste disposal etc. pollution can be further classified into various categories like water pollution air pollution noise pollution plastic pollution land pollution light pollution radioactive pollution etc. hence pollution is a phenomenon having adverse effect on our natural resources water air etc or on overall environment. air pollution water pollution soil pollution noise pollution land pollution thermal pollutionpollution in india is a big environmental issue which everyone must be aware of. our kids school going children middle class students and higher class students of classes etc usually get topics of pollution to write essay or recite speech on this. parents should know about the types causes and prevention measures of the pollution in order to help their kids. we have provided below some essay on pollution to help you and your kids. you can select any pollution essay according to the need and requirement pollution refers to the presence of contaminants in the natural environment. some of the examples of polluting substances are gases like carbon dioxide carbon monoxide etc solid pollutants like plastic sewage etc and chemicals like fertilizers as well as those produced as byproduct in factories transportation etc. the immediate effect of pollution is that it renders earth s natural resources unusable or in other words harmful to use as well as it also causes species depletion and ecological imbalance. it is very necessary to take essential precautionary and pro active measures to prevent any further damage that will happen due to pollution to earth and its inhabitants. introductionpollution today has become a global concern for the health of the environment as well as the flora and fauna on the planet. pollution has a widespread effect on the environment including the natural resources. it makes the natural elements polluted and harmful to use ultimately making the life on planet suffer. what is pollution when a polluting substance enters into our natural environment and contaminates it this process is called pollution. these pollutants are mostly formed due to several human activities mostly economical in nature. to state few examples carbon monoxide released by transportation vehicles pollute the air trail of oil left by big ocean liners pollute the ocean and makes water harmful for aquatic life. conclusionpollution is the immediate threat that the environment faces today and is also the most prominent one. the clock is ticking continuously and with every passing moment the damage to the environment is increasing. immediate action to preserve the environment against pollution is needed to be taken by the government and other stake holders. introductionin a lay man terms pollution occurs when something unwanted enters into your natural environment. the release of toxic gas on burning of plastic is pollution mixing of harmful chemicals with the soil when it is mixed with chemical fertilizers is pollution when the disposed waste from your house somehow reaches into the open environment it cause pollution. similarly there could be several other examples of pollution. as for now we will discuss below the types of pollution. types of pollutionthe five major types of pollution are given below air pollutionits main source is the burning of fossil fuels by the transportation vehicles and smoke emanated from the factories. water pollutionits main source is the runoff water from urban settlements agricultural fields and release of byproducts from factories. soil pollutionsoil pollution could be caused from several factors like improper disposal of waste use of harmful chemicals in agriculture industry etc. light pollutionlight pollution refers to more than required presence of light in a polluted area which is large enough to interfere with the natural environment. noise pollutionnoise pollution refers to the presence of excessive noise generated by human activities like road transport vehicles jet planes a busy market loudspeaker announcements etc. conclusionwhatever may be the type of pollution it always has a degrading effect on the environment and human health or else affects one or the other living species on earth. light pollution confuses roosting birds often causing fatal accidents. introductionthe problem of pollution is one of the most serious problems faced by humans nowadays. the rapid increase in pollution in the last few decades has started to question the existence of life. scientists all over the world publish reports related to pollution every day and warn us about its impending danger. effects of pollutionin present time the air of the cities has become so polluted that it has become difficult for humans to breathe. smoke emanating from vehicles and factories dissolves poisonous gases in the air. the waste released from factories is dumped in rivers and drains that causes water pollution and it has become difficult for people to get potable water for their use. aquatic animals in rivers and oceans are also on the verge of extinction. use of chemical fertilizers in the agricultural land has started making the field barren. some percentage of these chemicals remains in the food grains that are produced by using these fertilizers causing a great risk for the life. earth s temperature is rising due to pollution. the most important ozone layer is getting depleted. the weather is changing in many countries all around the globe. the rain pattern has been changed causing a lot of damage to agriculture. the ice caps are melting which increases the risk of drowning of the countries and cities along the sea coasts. conclusion in such a critical time it has become necessary that all the countries of the world come together to curb this problem of pollution. many solutions have been suggested by the environmentalists if they are actually implemented they would prove to be a golden ray of hope for mankind. introductionpollution is a defect arising in natural equilibrium due to the entry of contaminants into the environment. pollutants damage the environment and animals. pollution means contamination of air water soil etc. with unwanted liquids which has a direct adverse effect on living organisms and other indirect effects by damage to ecosystem. causes of pollutionthere are a lot of causes of pollution some of them are given below conclusion pollution is such a curse born from the womb of science and which most people of the world are compelled to bear today. human development process and modernity have an important contribution in pollution. introductionpollution has damaged the environment a lot now there is a need to think seriously to reduce it. concrete steps should be constituted executed and followed. though many programs have been scheduled many scientists have warned many environmentalists have shown their anxiety many ngos are working yet pollution is increasing day by day. effective ways to reduce pollutionconclusionthe ways suggested in above lines are the basics to reduce pollution if they all would be followed properly by each and every individual honestly. we have to become obstinate on our decisions once taken to reduce this danger. introductionthe world health organization released a list of the most polluted cities in the world. these include many cities in india. top cities of india which are included in this list are serving poison in the air and water making it unfit for the people. cities in india causing pollution at high levelthe capital city delhi is on the top. according to the particulate meter where the air should be pm. microns cubic meter its volume in delhi is micrograms cubic meter. while the amount of pm is microgram cubic meter also found here. in this context living in delhi can prove extremely difficult. especially for those who have breathing trouble. the air that is present in patna the capital of bihar can give heart and lung disease to a healthy person. the city ranks second on the who list. according to who the amount of pm. here is micrograms cubic meter while the amount of pm is micrograms cubic meter. the city of gwalior is considered more polluted than the major cities of india. the amount of toxin in the air is constantly increasing here. according to the who the quantity of pm. here is micrograms per cubic meter while the quantity of pm has been measured at micrograms per cubic meter. according to the who report this city is currently in fourth place but the speed with which the pollution of this city is increasing is a matter of concern. here pm. amounts to micrograms per cubic meter while pm amounts to micrograms per cubic meter. ahmedabad is known for its textile industries and due to these pollution is also increasing here. the amount of pm. is micrograms per cubic meter while the amount of pm is micrograms per cubic meter. the city is famous for making coloured glass bangles. but due to the glass industry pollution is also increasing here. the quantity of pm. was found to be micrograms per cubic meter while that of pm was. micrograms per cubic meter. kanpur is a dusty town due to many industries present here. here the quantity of pm. is micrograms per cubic meter while the quantity of pm is. micrograms per cubic meter. conclusionthe increasing pollution is a cause of concern for the people and unfortunately there is no place remained to live in a healthy atmosphere. introductionour environment is composed of air water soil plants and animals. all these important parts have a symbiotic relationship to each other to maintain mutual balance of the environment. but development processes have created an imbalance in them that leads to many problems and has given rise to pollution. meaning of pollutionthe accumulation of unwanted substances in the environment as a result of human activities is called pollution. the substances which pollute the environment are called pollutants. types of pollutioncauses of pollutioneffects of pollutionsolutions to control pollutionconclusionour earth is moving on the path of unhealthy future for every living being. therefore we need to be aware of the factors that pollute our environment and take some necessary steps to keep our future safe and healthy. introductiontoday the very existence of human life on planet earth along with the life of other flora and fauna is threatened up to a large extent by the pollution. pollution affects everything essential for survival natural resources species health etc. what is pollutionwhen any external unwanted substance generated by a human activity enters into the environment it causes pollution. causes of pollution are always human induced and the natural cause of pollution is almost negligible. there are a number of human activities those cause pollution. tons of toxic waste generated as a byproduct in factories is left into the rivers and streams polluting them thousands of cubic meters of harmful gases are released by transportation vehicles polluting the air improperly disposed waste from urban settlements got strewn on land and water resulting in land as well as water pollution. now that we have got an idea on what is pollution we will move on to discussing some of the significant effects of pollution. effects of pollution on environmentpollution has a widespread effect on the environment as discussed below polluted airpollution contaminates the natural air making it harmful to breathe. for example toxic gases released by transportation vehicles mix with the air resulting in its pollution. when this air is inhaled by a human or animal it causes severe respiratory ailments. some species of animals and plants which are highly sensitive to such kind of pollution die. polluted water bodiesimproper disposal of waste generated by areas of human settlements cause this waste to reach our naturally occurring water bodies in form of runoff. the urban waste consists of several toxic compounds including plastic. this waste is non biodegradable and stays in water making it hazardous to consume. it also results in the depletion of aquatic species population which are highly sensitive to pollution. soil toxicitypollution cause due to agricultural activities like the use of chemical fertilizers result in toxicity of the soils. chemical fertilizers are made up of harmful chemical compounds which got mixed with the soil ultimately making it toxic. it affects the species of flora as well as fauna those depend on the purity of the soil for their survival. species depletionone of the most prominent effects of pollution on the environment is the depletion of species. when polluting substances get mixed with our natural resources it harms the living species in some way or the other. gaseous pollutants cause severe respiratory ailments and decrease the life expectancy of the fauna and flora as well. global warmingglobal warming is one of the main effects of pollution which leads to a number of environmental effects. gaseous pollutants like carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide released due to the burning of fossil fuels stays in the atmosphere resulting in greenhouse effect. green house effect on the other hand is responsible for a number of factors like unexpected climatic changes resulting in droughts famine etc depletion in aquatic species like coral reefs fishes etc. conclusionthe effect of pollution on the environment is far and wide. not only the pollution effects present but also threaten the future of several species if no concrete action to prevent pollution is taken. the rate at which the pollution is being damaged is way too more than it could be repaired. it might take centuries to reverse the damages that we have done to the environment that too it won t be an easy task and will require strict discipline and will to tackle pollution. introductionenvironmental pollution is one of the most important threats faced by our planet in the present day scenario. it is a global issue commonly seen in all countries including third world countries regardless of their development status. it is largely seen in urban areas due to higher density of population and industries but rural areas are also not deprived of it. we can see its destructive impact on both areas and there is a need to handle it properly by taking concrete initiatives. let us talk about the harmful effect of pollution in rural areas as well as in the urban areas with the proper management to control it for future. pollution in urban areasnowadays everyone is well aware of the problem of pollution in towns and cities because the density of population in these areas is more due to access of employment. people are compelled to live in poor hygienic condition that makes their life worse. they are insisted on to live in slum areas breathe in polluted air drink contaminated water and eat adulterate food that is creating a lot of trouble for their health and life. many of them are prone to severe diseases like asthma bronchitis high blood pressure heart and kidney diseases etc. the main reasons of pollution in urban areas are smoke released by vehicles and small scale industries garbage and sanitation problem noise produced by horns and loudspeakers dust particles and plastic e waste and dust particles etc. pollution in rural areasvillages and small townships are also affected by pollution. due to industrialisation the harmful gases emanated by factories and vehicles mixes in atmosphere that reaches in those areas also. apart from these many industries like brick plants rice mills flour mills running in village areas and excessive use of modern machines in agriculture etc are also adding to pollution. the chemical fertilizers and pesticides used by farmers is depleting the texture of soil and decreasing its fertility. the food grains produced by using these harmful substances remain in them after harvesting causing health problems. in lack of proper knowledge the villagers are deprived of the basic amenities provided by the government. the money that is released by central government for the development of those areas is entangled in the caucus of corruption. the villagers also cut down trees for their use or money that makes the top fertile layer of soil depleted by soil erosion. they add a lot of smoke by burning the residue of agriculture causing poor quality index of air in nearby areas. there is no proper system of garbage control in villages and the villagers are addicted to go in open for defecation. this a major reason of ailments in that areas. pollution management and controlin response to disastrous effect of pollution every possible measure is being taken by various countries of the world. more awareness programs are being organized to educate people about the dangers of environmental pollution and the need to protect our planet. greener ways of living are becoming popular. energy efficient bulbs environmentally friendly vehicles the use of solar and wind energy to name a few. governments are emphasizing on planting more trees eliminating plastic products better recycling of natural wastes and less use of pesticides. such biological lifestyles have helped us save many plant and animal species from extinction in order to make the earth a living and healthy place. india has signed the historic paris climate agreement on november with countries. india has committed itself to the effective implementation of the paris agreement on climate change. prime minister of india sri narendra modi and french president emmanuel macron inaugurated uttar pradesh s largest solar power plant in mirzapur district on march. india has signed an agreement with germany on technical cooperation under the indo german energy program green energy corridor. government of india is taking serious steps to restore the sanctity of ganga and yamuna rivers by implementing namami gange and yamuna cleanliness program. since plastic is a major pollutant the maharashtra state government has banned plastic bags from june. an appeal from the p. m. of india on august to ban the single use plastic from the birth anniversary of mahatma gandhi i. e. october plastic is banned in all parts of india. conclusionof course some immediate relief is also important to make way forward. but this should not be our goal. the problem is that we are working on relief measures but even if pollution is not created we have to do very little effort for this while this should be the first priority to save the earth. introductionpollution refers to the presence of unwanted substances know as pollutants in the environment. pollution is an immediate threat to the environment and causes severe damage to it. lately the world is recognizing the need to deal with the pollution if the earth and its biodiversity are to be preserved. what is pollutionpollution occurs when an unwanted external compound mainly generated due to human activities enters into the environment. these compounds are referred to as the pollutants and cause severe damage to the environment. everything that constitutes the part of the environment that is the water bodies air flora and fauna are in some way or the other get affected by the pollution. moreover pollution also causes global effects like greenhouse gas effects global warming and acid rain. global warming refers to an increase in earth s average surface temperature and results in conditions like famine flood and drought. below we will discuss about the effects of pollution on major indian cities like delhi noida ghaziabad lucknow and varanasi. it must be known that an aqi between to is considered good to is considered as satisfactory to is considered as moderate to is considered as poor to is considered as very poor to is considered as severe and a value above is considered severe plus or emergency. pollution level in delhias per a survey done by the world health organization the national capital territory of delhi stands at the lowest position in terms of air quality index among other major cities around the world. in delhi children are the worst affected and as per a study nearly. million or of all children are suffering irreversible damages due to poor air quality. air quality index of delhi remains usually moderate during january to september months. however the aqi rapidly deteriorates during the onset of winter months from october to december. often during these months the aqi reaches to a hazardous level of plus. the particulate matter levels of pm. and pm particulate matters in delhi reach up the level of micrograms m. this is much above the safe limit which is mg m for pm. particles and mg m for pm particles. burning of the roots of paddy crop during the winter months in the adjoining states of punjab and haryana makes the situation worst in delhi by causing dense smoke. this method is traditionally called parali and is one of the prime constituents of pollution in delhi. pollution level in noidanoida also known as new okhla industrial development authority located in the western uttar pradesh bordering delhi is immediately behind the national capital in terms of poor air quality. incessant construction works in and around noida in addition to the heavy vehicular pollution and cold winter air causes a dense thick smog. the term smog is used for a mixture of smoke and fog suspended in the atmosphere. the air quality index of noida also gets very poor up to the level of during the winter months of october to december. the particulate matter level of this western up district is by and large at par with that of delhi often the two competing with each other for the highest concentration of particulate matters. pollution level in ghaziabadghaziabad often tops the list of north indian cities with worst air quality index and pollution. here also like delhi and noida the aqi goes past the hazardous level of plus mostly during the months of october to december. the main reason behind such a poor air quality index of ghaziabad is industrial pollution and waste burning. the city is flanked by the industries on the outskirts which results in a dense smoke emanating from the factories as well as from the transport vehicles plying to the industrial area. the pm level of ghaziabad reaches up to four times of permissible levels during october to december. sometimes this value is reached during the deepawali festival due to the incessant bursting of crackers and smoke emanated from them. pm particulate matter which has a permissible limit of microgram m often is recorded nearing around micrograms m in ghaziabad. pollution level in lucknowthe air quality index of the capital of uttar pradesh lucknow fluctuates between moderate and poor often crossing the plus mark. though the situation is definitely not as bad as delhi ncr nevertheless it still is alarming and requires concrete action. the worst air quality index of lucknow was recorded as in the first half of the november month. the quantity of suspended particulate matter has also increased significantly in lucknow s residential areas since the last decades. the air of lucknow is found to be consisting of very fine particulate matters pm. with concentration just below microgram m which is very highly hazardous indeed. pollution level in varanasithe ancient pilgrimage city of varanasi has always been in news for its everyday fluctuating population of tourists. being the parliamentary constituency of indian prime minister mr. narendra modi since it has become the centre of development with everyday construction works of some kind or the other. though the construction is good for the city s development point of view it is also causing some of the worst recorded downfalls in its air quality. aqi of varanasi in is ranked at the third position on the world health organization s list of fifteen most polluted cities in the world. the people of varanasi are facing respiratory ailments and other complications due to the ever continuing construction work. recorded air quality index of varanasi reaches up to which falls in the poor category. the level of particulate matter found in varanasi is pm. the value of which fluctuates within the range of microgram m to microgram m which is extremely unhealthy for sensitive groups and children. conclusionindia is home to some of the world s most polluted cities whose position remains almost uniform though sometimes shifting a place up or down. cities like delhi noida calcutta mumbai and varanasi all have obtained a position among the world s most polluted cities. there is an immediate need to tackle the situation with strong will and determination. it is the time when government people industries all should join hands to tackle the pollution and prevent the health and environmental hazards caused by it. introductionpollution has become a global concern in today s time. it has changed the face of our beautiful earth. it is slowly destroying our environment and making it difficult to survive here. several species of flora and fauna have become extinct because of the harmful impact of pollution and many others are on the verge of extinction. pollution has been divided into various categories based on its nature. different types of pollutions are causing harm to our planet in different ways. here is a look at the types of pollution their causes effects and the measures that can be taken to reduce them. types of pollutionhere is a look at the different types of pollution their causes and impact on the environment and life on earth. air pollution is said to be the most hazardous pollution. the primary cause of this pollution is the industrial and vehicular smoke. the harmful gases emitted by these sources pollute the air and make it difficult to breath. the increase in the number of factories and vehicles has led to the rise in air pollution. this has given rise to numerous health problems. bronchitis and lung diseases are two common health problems caused due to air pollution. air pollution is not only impacting human health but is also deteriorating the environment by contributing to global warming. the industrial and household waste often finds its way into the rivers and other water bodies thereby polluting them. our once pure and pious water bodies have now become a breeding ground for several diseases as these have been filled with large number of waste plastic products chemical wastes and other non biodegradable wastes. these pollutants mixed in water are impacting our health. water pollution has especially become a threat to the marine creatures. several of them die each day as a result of this pollution. the industrial and household waste that doesn t get dumped in the water keeps lying on the land. while attempts are made to destroy or recycle it a large amount of it does not get disposed off. this causes land pollution which becomes a breeding ground for mosquitoes flies and other insects that cause various deadly diseases. it also refers to the contamination of soil due to waste products that eventually turn toxic. soil pollution is also caused due to regular usage of insecticides pesticides and other strong chemicals. this type of pollution is often referred to as soil pollution. noise pollution is caused due to high intensity sound made by machines installed in factories. it is also caused due to the vehicles on the road the bursting of fire crackers and music played on loud speakers. noise pollution can cause stress and impact the brain adversely. it can also cause hearing impairment. light pollution is an excess unwanted or inappropriate light over a particular area. light pollution may be in the form of urban glow excessive unwanted glare over an urban area trespass light falling without want intent or need glare excessive light or bright light and clutter an unwanted group of lights like in an over lit urban areas. radioactive pollution refers to the presence of unwanted radioactive substances in the atmosphere. radioactive pollution could be a result of radioactive weapon explosion or testing mining and handling radioactive substances or accidents in radioactive power plants. radioactive substances present in atmosphere pollute even natural water resources making them harmful to consumption or even domestic use. thermal pollution refers to a sudden change in the temperature of water bodies a change that is big enough to disturb its ecological balance. use of water as coolants in various industries is the main reason of thermal pollution. when water used as coolant is suddenly released back into the water bodies it decreases its overall oxygen content as gases are less soluble in hotter liquids as a result aquatic life suffers due to sudden change in temperature and oxygen scarcity. anything human made which obstructs your view constitutes visual pollution. it includes bill boards sign boards antennas trash cans electric poles towers wires vehicles buildings etc. constant exposure to visual pollution may result in eye fatigue stress and depression. unplanned and non regulated construction of habitation is the major cause of visual pollution. most polluted cities around the worldwhile some cities around the globe have managed to keep the pollution levels low others are known for their alarming level of pollution. most polluted places around the world include kanpur delhi varanasi patna peshawar karachi shijiazhuang heze chernobyl bamenda beijing and moscow. these cities are known for poor air quality and enormous land and water pollution. life in these cities has become miserable and this is largely due to the negligence of people and government of these places. it is time they should take cue from the cities that have low levels of pollution and incorporate similar strategies to bring down their pollution level. ways to reduce pollutionnow that we know the causes and effects of different types of pollution let us understand how we can contribute towards reducing it. here are some of the ways by which we can bring down the pollution level vehicular smoke is a major cause of air pollution. with the increasing number of vehicles on the road the pollution levels are rising at a rapid speed. car pooling can help in reducing air pollution. car pooling means sharing the space in your car or your colleague s while travelling to work. it can also be brought down if we use public transport more often instead of travelling via our own cars each time. firecrackers burnt during festivals such as diwali dussehra and new year create a lot of air and noise pollution that leads to various health problems. these are especially disturbing for small babies elderly people and animals. we must act as responsible human beings and stop bursting crackers to avoid unnecessary pollution. waste plastic and other non biodegradable stuff adds to pollution on land and water. it must be brought down by avoiding their use. in case we use them we must not dispose them off and purchase new ones immediately we should reuse them a couple of times before disposing them off. we must also make an effort to send such used things for recycling. we must keep our surroundings clean by throwing the waste products in the dustbin rather than throwing them away on the land or into the water bodies. we can create a big impact if each one of us remains particular about keeping the environment clean. it is essential to restrict the use of insecticides pesticides fertilizers and other strong chemicals as they tend to cause soil pollution. it is suggested to use natural methods to fertilize the soil and keep insects at bay. plants and trees absorb harmful gases such as carbon di oxide and carbon monoxide and exhale the life giving oxygen. thus they help in reducing the effect of air pollution. we must plant more and more trees to ensure cleaner air. a compost pile is a good way to decompose waste food leaves and plants and turn them into fertilizer. it helps in clearing the waste material and turns it into something useful. it is easy to start and manage. avoiding the misuse or overuse of lights in our houses as well as cities will effectively reduce the light pollution. a particular area should have only that much light sources installed those are needed avoiding the installation of excess light sources. also the use of very bright and unwanted lights should be avoided at public places. the use of radioactive substances should be avoided in the first place and if it is to be used extreme caution must be exercised. respective governments should avoid the use of radioactive materials for destructive purposes like nuclear weapons weapons of mass destruction etc. industries using the natural resources should be made accountable for the damages they do to the environment. any industry using water as a coolant must be made to cool off the water to natural temperature before releasing it back into the water body. this will considerably reduce the thermal pollution and help retain our natural resources. today construction is carried out faster than ever before moreover it is unplanned and sporadic. such unregulated and unplanned construction results in visual pollution. if you are residing in a city then you know that it s difficult to see beyond a couple metres up or straight even if you are standing on a roof. cities must be planned in such a way that emphasis is also put on reducing the visual pollution. conclusionpollution is ruining our environment day by day. we must take it as our responsibility to reduce pollution by following the aforementioned methods in order to make our world a better place to live. if we continue to ignore this problem and keep adding to the pollution rather than looking for ways to reduce it we shall soon have to face fatal consequences.

something into the environment that is dirty unclean or has a harmful effect on the ecosystem. pollution is a key issue that has been affecting our earth. although it is an issue which has been prevalent since ancient times in the century its harmful effect has been felt on a large scale. although the governments of different countries have taken several major steps to curb these effects there is still a long way to go. several natural processes and cycles get disturbed due to this. not only that many flora and fauna today either have gone extinct or are endangered. due to the rapid increase in the amount of pollution animals are losing their habitat at a rapid speed. pollution has affected several major cities across the globe. a majority of these polluted cities lie in india. some of the most polluted cities of the world are delhi kanpur bamenda moscow heze chernobyl beijing among others. although these cities have taken several steps to curb pollution they still have a long way to go. the air quality of these places is poor and there are cases of land and water pollution as well. now its time that the administration of these cities prepares strategies to check these issues. basically there are four types of pollution air pollution water pollution noise pollution and soil pollution. let s discuss them one by one although these are the four major types of pollution but lifestyle changes have caused several other types of pollution as well such as radioactive pollution light pollution among others. if a place ends up getting light in excess or in unwanted amount then it contributes to light pollution. nowadays several urban areas are facing unwanted glares in excess amount. this is due to the fact that most indian cities such as mumbai bangalore delhi chennai etc. have an active nightlife. we are living in the nuclear era. since a lot of countries are developing their own nuclear devices it has lead to an increase in the presence of radioactive substances in the atmosphere of the earth. this is known as radioactive pollution. handling and mining of radioactive substances testing minor accidents occurring in radioactive power plants are other major causes contributing to radioactive pollution. global warming is another name for climate change. the blanket of pollution that traps the heat around our planet is the main reason why global warming is increasing nowadays. as humans burn fossil fuels vehicles emit harmful gases jungles burn at alarming rates all these factors are the main reasons. once it enters the earth s atmosphere eventually spreading across the globe. as a result heat gets trapped around the earth for the next or years after it starts emitting again. the worst part is harmful gases such as carbon dioxide have increased at an alarming rate. due to this the upcoming generation will feel the effects of global warming for hundreds of years. the authorities at national and international level have taken several steps to curb the pollution issue. some of these are as follows under its banner the uno in had initiated united nations environment program in order to address the issue of pollution. it has issued several issues such as climate change ecosystem management environmental governance resource efficiency etc. it has lead to several successful treaties such as the montreal protocol to limit the emission of gases that were thinning the protective ozone layer minamata convention to limit the use of toxic mercury etc. unep sponsored solar loan programme where lakhs of people from different countries were provided with solar power panels. although the authorities of different cities are working hard to curb the pollution issue however it is the duty of citizens and common people also to contribute to this process. few of the important ways to curb all types of pollution are pollution is a problem that we need to solve at the earliest so that humans can live safely on this planet. it is important that we follow the suggested measures to curb this issue. its our responsibility to make our place a better place for living. in order to make the earth survive we have to stop polluting it. also see

comes from all types of sources with various consequences. pollution is harmful to the natural world and human health. if youre environmentally conscious understanding the pollution basics can help you to minimize your contribution to pollution. air pollution is any contamination of the atmosphere that disturbs the natural composition and chemistry of the air. this can be in the form of particulate matter such as dust or excessive gases like carbon dioxide or other vapors that cant be effectively removed through the natural cycles of the carbon cycle or the nitrogen cycle. some of the most excessive sources of air pollution include depending on the concentration of air pollutants several effects can be noticed. for example polluted air results in smog increase higher rain acidity crop depletion from inadequate oxygen and higher rates of asthma in the human population. some scientists believe that climate change is also related to increased air pollution. according to the world health organization each year million people worldwide die from air pollution. who states the annually death rate from ambient outdoor air pollution is. million people worldwide. the organizations statistics also reveal an annual death rate from exposure to household smoke from fuels and dirty cookstoves is. million people. of the worlds population who reports that live where air quality exceeds the limits of the who guidelines. water pollution means any contaminated water whether from chemical particulate or bacterial matter that degrades the waters quality and purity. water pollution can occur in oceans rivers lakes and underground reservoirs. the pollution spreads from different water sources flowing together through the natural water cycle. causes of water pollution include the effects of water pollution include decreasing the quantity of drinkable water available lowering water supplies for crop irrigation and impacting fish and wildlife populations that require water of a certain purity for survival. one of the worst water contaminants is untreated wastewater from municipalities and industries. this type of pollution leaches into the soil and water. the united nations educational scientific and cultural organization reports on municipal and industrial wastewater contamination to world water supplies in various countries. for example in europe of municipal and industrial wastewater is treated but in latin america counties that figure is only. middle east and north africa statistics fall around whereas asia and the pacific region is between and. untreated wastewater is simply released and pollutes land water coastal ecosystems. its estimated that water from u. s. major rivers is used and reused more than times before it finally reaches the ocean. nineteen percent of u. s. households are connected to septic tanks for treatment and disposal of wastewater. the un statistics revealed. of the u. s. population was connected to wastewater treatment. soil or land pollution is soil contamination that prevents the natural growth and balance of the land. pollution can be present in land used for cultivation habitation or as a wildlife preserve. some soil pollution is deliberate such as the creation of landfills. however much of soil land pollution is accidental and can have widespread effects. soil pollution sources include soil contamination can lead to poor growth and reduced crop yields. wildlife habitats can be destroyed. water and visual pollution are often the result of soil pollution. other results include soil erosion and desertification. according to the conservation institute soil pollution is attributed to deforestation and soil erosion agricultural chemicals industrialization mining landfills and human sewage. the loss of topsoil is attributed to fertilizers and the use of pesticides in farming practices. these chemicals create a breeding ground for harmful and devastating fungi that lead to land erosion. noise pollution refers to undesirable levels of noises caused by human activity that disrupt the standard of living in the affected area. noise pollution can come from some noise pollution may be temporary while other sources are more permanent. effects may include hearing loss wildlife disturbances and a general degradation of lifestyle. early childhood development and education can be impaired from noise. the who reports that studies and statistics on children exposed to chronic aircraft noise suffer from impaired cognitive performance well being and moderate evidence of blood pressure and catecholamine hormone secretions are effected. the who reports environmental noise and its effect on human health. in the eu road traffic noise exceeds db with of the eu population exposed. suffer from exposure to more than db levels. more than are exposed to nighttime noise levels of more than db. the acoustical society of america reports that in only to americans were exposed to noise created by vehicles. that percentage in was.. radioactive pollution is rare but extremely detrimental and even deadly when it occurs. because of its intensity and the difficulty of reversing damage there are strict government regulations to control radioactive pollution. sources of radioactive contamination include radiation pollution can cause birth defects cancer sterilization and other health problems for human and wildlife populations. it can also sterilize the soil and contribute to water and air pollution. according to the u. s. nuclear regulatory commission of radioactive pollution is the result of natural sources while comes from anthropogenic sources. thermal pollution is excess heat that creates undesirable effects over long periods of time. the earth has a natural thermal cycle but excessive temperature increases can be considered a rare type of pollution with long term effects. many types of thermal pollution are confined to areas near their source but multiple sources can have wider impacts over a greater geographic area. thermal pollution may be caused by when temperatures increase mild climatic changes may be observed. swift changes make wildlife populations vulnerable and they may be unable to recover. thermal pollution can be seen as a result of various manufacturers. for example illinois state water survey reports the highest heat emissions worldwide are found in the mississippi river generated by coal burning power plants. the most polluted basin in the world from thermal pollution is found in europe the rhine river. light pollution is the over illumination of an area that is considered obtrusive. light pollution isnt just found in cities. much of the modern world suffers from light pollution. sources include light pollution can interfere with the normal sleep cycle. if it is near residential areas light pollution can also degrade the quality of life for residents. light pollution makes it impossible to see stars therefore interfering with astronomical observation and personal enjoyment. the national institutes of health reveals a growing body of work that suggests light pollution may have long term ill effect on humans and wildlife. exposure to light photons that hit your retinas can disrupt the circadian rhythm of humans and animals. another effect of light pollution is the inability to see the night sky. this is troublesome to astronomers and anyone wishing to enjoy star gazing. in the new world atlas of artificial night sky brightness reported that of the world resides under light pollution. in fact of the populations of the united states and europe live under skies of light pollution. more than a third of the worlds population is unable to see the milky way. this breaks down to north americans and europeans never see the milky way. visual pollution is more than an aesthetic eyesore or undesirable unattractive views. it can lower the quality of life in certain areas and have an economic impact on property values as well as personal enjoyment. sources of visual pollution include while visual pollution has a few health or environmental effects is the pollution that can have detrimental affects. most of the effects impact those living near or in this type of pollution. visual pollution presents a hazard and alters the community identity. for example visual pollution can be distracting while driving a vehicle or operating equipment and can lead to traffic congestion. the european scientific journal published a study in june called visual pollution can have a deep degrading effect on urban and suburban community a study in few places of bengal india with special reference to unorganized billboards. the study concluded that developed countries recognized and were taking steps to reduce visual pollution. the researchers concluded that in developing countries garbage is a greater nuisance and health problem than it is a visual pollution issue. personal pollution is the contamination of ones body and lifestyle with detrimental actions. this may include according to the epa personal pollution includes all types of pharmaceuticals and personal care products. the human and veterinarian products create trace environmental pollutants found in both surface waters and ground waters. personal pollution gained its own category but no studies have been made directly assessing personal pollution. however there are studies on various types of personal pollution such as turf fertilizers found in epa reports on nutrient pollution another type of pollution not commonly reported. the epa reports nutrient pollution is a challenge since it is a big problem that is spread throughout the u. s. excessive phosphorous and nitrogen discharged into the water and air is largely blamed on personal pollution or human activities such as fertilizers sewage discharge from treatment plants animal manure runoff pet waste and more. row crop runoff and animal feeding operations are a major cause. intertwined with other forms of pollution such as its carriers of air and water and personal pollution nutrient pollution impacts all of these areas as well as human health. water charged with nutrient pollution can generate algae that overcomes the water systems. shellfish aquatic and marine life suffer when they absorb the toxins created by algae blooms. eating contaminated shellfish or drinking water from this source can make a person very ill and in extreme cases lead to death. the mississippi river basin runs through states before it empties into the gulf of mexico. nutrient pollution effects this ecosystem. the epa reports in the united states littering is a form of pollution that can fall into several other types of pollutions such as personal visual water and soil. any type of waste or trash carelessly discarded without proper disposal is the definition of littering. this can include anything from fast food containers bottles paper and plastic packaging sales receipts electronic waste etc. the type of litter often determines the effect it has on the environment. for example some litter contains harmful chemicals that can find their way into water and soil. plastics can harm wildlife that either get trapped in plastic bags and die or marine life that consumes small pieces of broken down plastic. the leading national nonprofit keep america beautiful reports statistics on the types of litter in the united states. these figures show less litter in residential neighborhoods than along the roads. when it comes to convenience stores and commercial areas the surrounding roadways have more litter. keep america beautiful report on percentages of roadside litter and sources all types of pollution are interconnected. for example light pollution requires energy to be made which means the electric plant needs to burn more fossil fuels to supply the electricity. those fossil fuels can contribute to air pollution which returns to the earth as acid rain and increases water pollution. the cycle of pollution can go on indefinitely but once you understand the different pollution types how they are created and the effects they can have you can make personal lifestyle changes to combat poor conditions for yourself and others around you. rebecca lake is a freelance writer and virtual assistant living in the southeast. she has been writing professionally since for various websites. lake received her masters degree in criminal justice from charleston southern university. pollution is a significant problem facing the environment. as the worlds population continues to grow so does the amount of potentially toxic substances that are released into the ecosystem. environmental pollutants can be derived from a number of sources. knowing what the different types of pollution are and where they come from can help you to understand the potential impact of these pollutants on your health and the health of the planet. soil pollution is the pollution of the earths land surfaces. according to green pack the most common types of soil pollutants are heavy metals such as cadmium chromium copper zinc or mercury pesticides or herbicides organic chemicals oils and tars explosive or toxic gases combustible or radioactive materials biologically active compounds and asbestos. these types of pollutants can enter the soil through poor agricultural practices industrial runoff mining landfill leakage littering or the improper or illegal dumping of household or industrial waste materials. air pollution is the pollution of the earths atmosphere. the u. s. environmental protection agency identifies six types of common air pollutants. they include ozone particulate matter carbon monoxide nitrogen oxides sulfur dioxide and lead. these and other air pollutants typically enter the atmosphere through industrial processes related to the generation of heat and power incineration of solid wastes and transportation. according to the university of the western cape emissions from vehicles are estimated to be responsible for approximately of all air pollution alone and of air pollution in cities. water pollution is the pollution of the earths oceans and other water sources. according to the minnesota center for environmental recovery common types of water pollutants include mercury nitrates phosphorous fecal coliform and bacterial pollution. these and other types of pollutants enter the water supply through industrial waste runoff sewage treatment plants feedlots urban and agricultural runoff septic systems and the illegal dumping of solid waste. noise pollution is a form of air pollution related specifically to the types of sound present in the atmosphere. the environmental protection agency defines a noise pollutant as any sound that interferes with normal activities or disrupts or diminishes ones quality of life. noise pollutants can be present in the home school work or the community at large. different types of noise pollutants may include sounds generated by aircraft trains boats automobile traffic construction industrial manufacturing vehicle alarms or even loud music. copyright leaf group ltd. use of this web site constitutes acceptance of the livestrong. com terms of use privacy policy and copyright policy. the material appearing on

types of pollution. pollution refers to the addition of contaminating substances to the natural environment resulting in an adverse impact on the environment. pollution can be of different types depending on the part of the environment that is getting polluted. below are explanations of the types of pollution. air pollution refers to the release of pollutants like toxic gases biological molecules and particulate matter into the atmosphere. the pollutants can be derived from several sources including both natural processes and human activity. volcanic eruptions limnic eruptions automobile and industrial effluents etc. are some examples of air pollution sources. carbon monoxide carbon dioxide chlorofluorocarbons aerosol sprays etc. are some examples of air pollutants. such pollution can be highly detrimental to the health and well being of all life forms on earth. air pollution refers to the release of pollutants like toxic gases biological molecules and particulate

detrimental to the health and well being of all life forms on earth. the pollution of the night environment by anthropogenic light is known as light pollution. this type of pollution is caused by an excessive lighting of the streets flood lights used in stadiums lights used in an industrial area etc. the negative effects of light pollution include the spoilage of the aesthetic environment of a place creating disturbances in the ecosystem and also harming the health of living creatures. the pollution of the night environment by anthropogenic light is known as light pollution. this type of pollution is caused by an excessive lighting of the streets flood lights used in stadiums lights used in an industrial area etc. the negative effects of light pollution include the spoilage of the aesthetic environment of a place creating disturbances in the ecosystem and also harming the health of living creatures. when the environment is filled with unnecessary or unpleasant sounds that are harmful to animals and plants it is called noise pollution. transport vehicles machinery industries loud music people yelling etc. are some of the most common sources of noise pollution. this type of pollution on the long term can give rise to chronic diseases like cardiovascular diseases. the psychological health of people can also be affected by noise. when the environment is filled with

sources of noise pollution. this type of pollution on the long term can give rise to chronic diseases like cardiovascular diseases. the psychological health of people can also be affected by noise. as the name suggests plastic pollution is caused by plastic accumulation in the environment. plastic a non biodegradable substance is extremely harmful to all life on earth. every year thousands of animals lose their lives due to plastic pollution. ingestion of plastics or entanglement in plastic objects kill these animals. most of the plastic waste generated in the world end up in the oceans where they cause great harm to the marine ecosystem. as the name suggests plastic pollution is caused by plastic accumulation in the environment. plastic a non biodegradable substance is extremely

plastic waste generated in the world end up in the oceans where they cause great harm to the marine ecosystem. an induced change in the temperature of large volumes of water causes thermal pollution. this type of pollution leads to the degradation of water quality as the warm water does not provide ideal living conditions for aquatic flora and fauna. for example when water used as a coolant in power plants or that used in industries is released into a natural water body the warm or hot water mixes with the rest of the water to raise the overall temperature of the aquatic ecosystem. higher temperatures also alter the composition of dissolved elements in water. the flora and fauna living in the area that was earlier adapted to a particular temperature range can be killed by this abrupt change in the water temperature. thus aquatic life experiences a thermal shock due to thermal pollution. an induced change in the temperature of large volumes of water causes thermal pollution. this

ugly barriers to this vision of open and clutter free landscapes it is called visual pollution. the installation of billboards open storage of trash networks of electric wires crisscrossing each other above the street etc. create visual pollution. this type of pollution generates distraction eye fatigues diversity in opinions and other psychological problems. everyone loves to see clean and green

psychological problems. in simple terms the contamination of water bodies likes lakes rivers ponds aquifers etc. by pollutants is called water pollution. like air pollution water pollution is one of the most harmful types of pollution. it can have extremely disastrous consequences for all living beings using the contaminated water. a major volume of the all the pollutants produced on land end up in water bodies. toxic wastes released by industries pathogens released in sewage harmful chemicals present in agricultural runoffs etc. are some of the top water pollutants. the contamination of water can lead to epidemics and even pandemics that can wipe out the population of an entire species or even more than one species. thus water pollution has a highly adverse impact on the environment society and economy of a place. in simple terms the contamination of water bodies likes lakes rivers ponds aquifers etc. by pollutants is called water pollution. like air pollution water pollution is

environment society and economy of a place. when radioactive substances are present in areas where their presence is undesirable or unintended it results in a type of pollution called radioactive contamination. such substances are highly toxic to all life on earth. radioactive substances trigger mutations in the genetic material of living organisms leading to different types of cancers. exposure to such toxins can also adversely impact the different systems of the body. death or disfiguration are common effects of exposure to radioactive waste. irresponsible management of such wastes or radioactive disasters are the common causes of radioactive contamination. when radioactive substances are present in areas where their presence is undesirable or unintended it results in a type of

irresponsible management of such wastes or radioactive disasters are the common causes of radioactive contamination. when the soil of an area is contaminated it leads to soil pollution or land degradation. the soil is essential to the growth of all plants including crops. thus a degradation in the soil quality translates to lower yields and poor health of crops grown on such soil. industrial and agricultural chemicals are the common pollutants contaminating the soil. when the soil of an area is contaminated it leads to soil pollution or land degradation. the soil is essential to the growth of all plants including crops. thus a degradation in the soil quality translates to lower yields and poor health of crops grown on such soil. industrial and agricultural chemicals are the common pollutants contaminating the soil. when waste products generated by humans is not disposed of properly it is called littering. here waste can include anything that is discarded by humans after use like bottles glass packaging material electronic waste metal waste etc. some of these pollutants like electronics batteries tires etc. are hazardous to the health of the environment. when chemicals from such wastes leach into the soil or enter the water bodies they cause soil contamination and water pollution. finally these chemicals enter the bodies of organisms to cause disease and death. when waste products generated by humans is not disposed of properly it is called littering. here waste can include anything that is discarded by humans after use like bottles glass packaging

flags photos and original descriptions worldatlas. comrenewable resources coalitionenvironmental pollution is currently the biggest challenge facing the word today. in the united states of rivers and of lakes are too polluted for fishing swimming and aquatic life. not surprising though when. trillion gallons of untreated storm water industrial waste and untreated sewage are being discharge annually into american waters. one third of the topsoil in the world is already degraded and with the current rate of soil degradation caused be improper agricultural and industrial practices and deforestation most of the world s topsoil could be gone within the next years. the great smog in killed people in london. this event was caused by a period of cold weather combined with windless conditions that formed a dense layer of airborne pollutants mostly from coal plants over the city. there are many sources of pollution and each one has its own effect on the environment and living organisms. this article will discuss the causes and effects of the different kinds of pollution. the causes of pollution are not just limited to fossil fuels and carbons emissions. there are many other types of pollution including chemical pollution into bodies of water and soil through improper disposal practices and agricultural activities and noise and light pollution created by cities and urbanization as a result of population growth. there are two types of air pollutants primary and secondary. primary pollutants are emitted directly from their source while secondary pollutants are formed when primary pollutants react in the atmosphere. the burning of fossil fuels for transportation and electricity produces both primary and secondary pollutants and is one of the biggest sources of air pollution. the fumes from car exhausts contain dangerous gases and particulates including hydrocarbons nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide. these gases rise into the atmosphere and react with other atmospheric gases creating even more toxic gases. according to the earth institute the heavy use of fertilizer for agriculture is a major contributor of fine particulate air pollution with most of europe russia china and the united states being affected. the level of pollution caused by agricultural activities is thought to outweigh all other sources of fine particulate air pollution in these countries. ammonia is the primary air pollutant that comes from agricultural activities. ammonia enters the air as a gas from concentrated livestock waste and fields that are over fertilized. this gaseous ammonia then combines with other pollutants such as nitrogen oxides and sulfates created by vehicles and industrial processes to create aerosols. aerosols are tiny particles that can penetrate deep into the lungs and cause heart and pulmonary disease. other agricultural air pollutants include pesticides herbicides and fungicides. all of which also contribute to water pollution. nutrient pollution is caused by wastewater sewage and fertilizers. the high levels of nutrients in these sources end up in bodies of water and promote algae and weed growth which can make the water undrinkable and depleted oxygen causing aquatic organisms to die. pesticides and herbicides applied to crops and residential areas concentrate in the soil and are carried to the groundwater by rainwater and runoff. for these reasons anytime someone drills a well for water it must be checked for pollutants. industrial waste is one of the main causes of water pollution by creating primary and secondary pollutants including sulphur lead and mercury nitrates and phosphates and oil spills. in developing countries around of their solid waste is dumped directly into the ocean or sea. this causes serious problems including the harming and killing of sea creatures which ultimately affects humans. land pollution is the destruction of land as a result of human s activities and the misuse of land resources. this occurs when humans apply chemicals such as pesticides and herbicides to the soil dispose of waste improperly and irresponsibly exploit minerals through mining. soil is also polluted through leaking underground septic tanks sewage systems the leaching of harmful substances from landfill and direct discharge of waste water by industrial plants into rivers and oceans. rain and flooding can bring pollutants from other already polluted lands to soil at other locations. over farming and over grazing by agricultural activities causes the soil to lose its nutrient value and structure causing soil degradation another type of soil pollution. landfills can leach harmful substances into the soil and water ways and create very bad smells and breeding grounds for rodents that transmit diseases. noise is considered an environmental pollutant caused by household sources social events commercial and industrial activities and transportation. light pollution is caused by the prolonged and excessive use of artificial lights at night that can cause health problems in humans and disrupt natural cycles including wildlife activities. sources of light pollution include electronic billboards night sports grounds street and car lights city parks public places airports and residential areas. the effects of pollution can be seen every day all around you. pollution is destroying ecosystems and drinking water and wreaking havoc on human and environmental health. high levels of air pollution can cause an increased risk of heart attack wheezing coughing and breathing problems and irritation of the eyes nose and throat. air pollution can also cause worsening of existing heart problems asthma and other lung complications. like humans animals can suffer from a number of health problems due to air pollution including birth defects reproductive failure and diseases. air pollution causes a number of environmental effects in addition to the effects on humans and animals. acid rain contains high levels of nitric and sulfuric acids that are created by oxides and sulfur oxides released into the air by the burning of fossil fuels. acid rain damages trees and acidifies soils and water bodies making the water too acidic for fish and other aquatic life. nitrogen oxides released into the air by the burning of fossil fuels also contribute to the nitrogen responsible for toxic algae blooms. the release of man made compounds including hydrochlorofluorocarbons chlorofluorocarbons and halons formerly used as coolants foaming agents pesticides solvents aerosol propellants and fire extinguishers are depleting the ozone. the ozone layer in the stratosphere forms a protective layer that reflects harmful ultraviolet rays back into space that would otherwise destroy animal and plant life. water pollution is a serious threat to humans animals and aquatic life. the effects of water pollution depend on which chemicals are being dumped where. bodies of water that are near urbanized areas tend to be heavily polluted by dumbing of garbage and chemicals both legally and illegally by industrial plants health centers and individuals. by far the biggest consequence of water pollution is the death of aquatic creatures which can disrupt the entire food chain. pollutants such as cadmium mercury and lead are eaten by tiny aquatic organisms that are then eaten by fish and shell fish becoming more concentrated with each step up the food chain and causing serious problems in humans and wildlife. nutrient pollution can cause toxic algal blooms in drinking water sources that create toxins that kill fish and other aquatic animals. direct exposure to this toxic alga causes serious health problems in humans including neurological effects respiratory problems stomach and liver illness and rashes. a consequential problem is created when disinfectants used to treat drinking water reach water polluted with toxic algae they react creating dioxins. dioxins are extremely harmful chemical compounds that have been linked with reproductive and development problems and even cancer. nitrates caused by fertilizers also contaminate drinking water and according to the environmental protection agency babies who consume water that is high in nitrates can become seriously ill with blue baby syndrome which causes shortness of breath and blue tinted skin and can lead to death if not treated early. land and soil pollution has substantial consequences for humans animals microorganisms and aquatic life. contaminated land and soil can cause various problems on the skin respiratory problems and even different kinds of cancers. these toxic substances come into contact with the human body directly through eating fruits and vegetables that have been grown in polluted soils being consumed through drinking water that has been contaminated direct contact with the skin and breathing in air polluted with particles and dust. deforestation is the biggest concern when it comes to land degradation and soil erosion. clear cutting of vegetation and tree cover creates harsh conditions that destroy ecosystems and habitats. deforestation also creates an imbalance in atmospheric conditions reducing the amount of carbon that is naturally taken out of the atmosphere. this is a serious problem considering that most pollution created by people is carbon based. noise pollution can cause stress anxiety headaches irritability hearing loss and sleep loss resulting in decreased productivity. oil drills submarines and other vessels on and in the ocean can cause excessive noise that has resulted in the injury or death of marine animals especially whales. too much light causes eye strain and stress harming our eyes and decreasing our quality of life. light pollution also causes a decrease in the hormone melatonin that helps us to fall asleep resulting in restlessness and fatigue. many mammals insects birds and reptiles are photoperiodic meaning their movement mating growth and development and eating cycles are regulated by natural light patterns. light pollution can interfere with these natural behaviors and cycles causing a decrease in wildlife populations. pollution needs to be dramatically reduced because it is destroying the environment we live in contaminating our food and water causing diseases and cancers in humans and wildlife and destroying the air we breathe and the atmosphere that protects us from harmful ultra violet radiation. it is the responsibility of every living person to protect the environment and with the population ever increasing pollution problems are only going to get worse unless we do something about it. protecting the environment is a long and daunting task requiring continuous planning governmental policies and public and industrial participation. however the result of ignoring the problem will be catastrophic and life as we know it will begin to end. by decreasing waste implementing recycling policies banning dangerous agricultural chemicals and developing safe renewable energy we can significantly reduce the amount of pollution going into the environment annually and increase our quality of living. everyone is entitled to clean air to breathe water to drink and public lands to enjoy. if you have any ideas on how to reduce pollution please drop a comment and

pollutants in the water bodies without any treatment to remove harmful compounds. water pollution adversely affects not only aquatic plants and animals but it also affects human beings and ecosystems. water pollution is caused due to several reasons. here are the few major causes of water pollution sewage and waste water sewage garbage and liquid waste of households agricultural lands and factories are discharged into lakes and rivers. these wastes contain harmful chemicals and toxins which make the water poisonous for aquatic animals and plants. dumping dumping of solid wastes and litters in water bodies causes huge problems. litters include glass plastic aluminum styrofoam etc. different things take different amount of time to degrade in water. they affect aquatic plants and animals. industrial waste industrial waste contains pollutants like asbestos lead mercury and petrochemicals which are extremely harmful to both people and environment. industrial waste is discharged into lakes and rivers by using fresh water making the water contaminated. oil pollution sea water gets polluted due to oil spilled from ships and tankers while traveling. the spilled oil does not dissolve in water and forms a thick sludge polluting the water. acid rain acid rain is pollution of water caused by air pollution. when the acidic particles caused by air pollution in the atmosphere mix with water vapor it results in acid rain. global warming due to global warming there is an increase in water temperature. this increase in temperature results in death of aquatic plants and animals. this also results in bleaching of coral reefs in water. eutrophication eutrophication is an increased level of nutrients in water bodies. this results in bloom of algae in water. it also depletes the oxygen in water which negatively affects fish and other aquatic animal population. it is very important to prevent the polluting of water bodies and remove existing contaminants or reducing the concentration of these contaminants so as to make it fit for desired use. following are some of the ways of treating polluted water industrial treatment the raw sewage is needed to be treated correctly in a water treatment plant before it can be safely released into the environment. to reduce the amount and toxicity of waste it is passed through a number of chambers and chemical processes in water treatment plant. denitrification conversion of nitrates in gas is called denitrification. it is an ecological approach to prevent leaching of nitrates in soil. it stops ground water from getting contaminated. ozone waste water treatment ozone waste water treatment method is becoming very popular. in this method the pollutants in water are broken down by an ozone generator. ozone oxidizes bacteria molds organic material and other pollutants in water. septic tanks septic tanks are used to treat sewage at the place of location instead of treating it in any plant or sewage system. this system is used at the individual building level. the sewage is separated into solid and liquid components and treated separately. causes of water pollution conserve water effects of water

the planet as a whole. the clean air act authorizes the u. s. environmental protection agency to protect public health by regulating the emissions of these harmful air pollutants. the nrdc has been a leading authority on this law since it was established in. most air pollution comes from energy use and production says john walke director of the clean air project part of the climate and clean air program at nrdc. burning fossil fuels releases gases and chemicals into the air. and in an especially destructive feedback loop air pollution not only contributes to climate change but is also exacerbated by it. air pollution in the form of carbon dioxide and methane raises the earth s temperature walke says. another type of air pollution is then worsened by that increased heat smog forms when the weather is warmer and there s more ultraviolet radiation. climate change also increases the production of allergenic air pollutants including mold and pollen. while we ve made progress over the last plus years improving air quality in the u. s. thanks to the clean air act climate change will make it harder in the future to meet pollution standards which are designed to protect health says kim knowlton senior scientist and deputy director of the nrdc science center. these two are the most prevalent types of air pollution. smog or ground level ozone as it is more wonkily called occurs when emissions from combusting fossil fuels react with sunlight. soot or particulate matter is made up of tiny particles of chemicals soil smoke dust or allergens in the form of gas or solids that are carried in the air. the epa s plain english guide to the clean air act states in many parts of the united states pollution has reduced the distance and clarity of what we see by percent. the sources of smog and soot are similar. both come from cars and trucks factories power plants incinerators enginesanything that combusts fossil fuels such as coal gas or natural gas walke says. the tiniest airborne particles in sootwhether they re in the form of gas or solidsare especially dangerous because they can penetrate the lungs and bloodstream and worsen bronchitis lead to heart attacks and even hasten death. smog can irritate the eyes and throat and also damage the lungsespecially of people who work or exercise outside children and senior citizens. it s even worse for people who have asthma or allergiesthese extra pollutants only intensify their symptoms and can trigger asthma attacks. these are either deadly or have severe health risks even in small amounts. almost are regulated by law some of the most common are mercury lead dioxins and benzene. these are also most often emitted during gas or coal combustion incinerating or in the case of benzene found in gasoline walke says. benzene classified as a carcinogen by the epa can cause eye skin and lung irritation in the short term and blood disorders in the long term. dioxins more typically found in food but also present in small amounts in the air can affect the liver in the short term and harm the immune nervous and endocrine systems as well as reproductive functions. lead in large amounts can damage children s brains and kidneys and even in small amounts it can affect children s iq and ability to learn. mercury affects the central nervous system. polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons or pahs are toxic components of traffic exhaust and wildfire smoke. in large amounts they have been linked to eye and lung irritation blood and liver issues and even cancer. in one recent study the children of mothers who d had higher pah exposure during pregnancy had slower brain processing speeds and worse symptoms of adhd. by trapping the earth s heat in the atmosphere greenhouse gases lead to warmer temperatures and all the hallmarks of climate change rising sea levels more extreme weather heat related deaths and increasing transmission of infectious diseases like lyme. according to a epa study carbon dioxide was responsible for percent of the country s total greenhouse gas emissions and methane made up percent. carbon dioxide comes from combusting fossil fuels and methane comes from natural and industrial sources including the large amounts that are released during oil and gas drilling walke says. we emit far larger amounts of carbon dioxide but methane is significantly more potent so it s also very destructive. another class of greenhouse gases hydrofluorocarbons are thousands of times more powerful than carbon dioxide in their ability to trap heat. in october more than countries reached an agreement to reduce the use of these chemicalswhich are used in air conditioners and refrigeratorsand find greener alternatives over time. david doniger director of nrdc s climate and clean air program writes nrdc estimates that the agreed hfc phase down will avoid the equivalent of more than billion tons of co over the next years. mold and allergens from trees weeds and grass are also carried in the air are exacerbated by climate change and can be hazardous to health. they are not regulated by the government and are less directly connected to human actions but they can be considered air pollution. when homes schools or businesses get water damage mold can grow and can produce allergenic airborne pollutants knowlton says. mold exposure can precipitate asthma attacks or an allergic response and some molds can even produce toxins that would be dangerous for anyone to inhale. pollen allergies are worsening because of climate change. lab and field studies are showing that the more carbon dioxide pollen producing plantsespecially ragweedare grown in the bigger they grow and the more pollen they produce knowlton says. climate change also extends the pollen production season and some studies are beginning to suggest that ragweed pollen itself might be becoming a more potent allergen. that means more people will suffer runny noses fevers itchy eyes and other symptoms. the less gasoline we burn the better we re doing to reduce air pollution and harmful effects of climate change walke says. make good choices about transportation. when you can walk ride a bike or take public transportation. for driving choose cars that get better miles per gallon of gas or choose an electric car. you can also investigate your power provider optionsyou may be able to request that your electricity be supplied by wind or solar. buying your food locally cuts down on the fossil fuels burned in trucking or flying food in from across the country. and perhaps most important support leaders who push for clean air and water and responsible steps on climate change walke says. as greenhouse gasses fill the sky a progressive governor and worried residents take on oil and gasthe state s most powerful industry. also the self styled environmentalist in chief skips a climate summit and the epa s science advisory board misses a big big deadline. plus national parks are getting hazy and trump makes a quixotic bid to buy greenland. trump also kills years of child health research and continues to neglect chemical safety. the tireless efforts of locals are reshaping one of new jersey s most polluted areas. the air in southwestern indiana is bad enough without the emissions from yet another proposed polluter. ten years after the disaster at a tennessee power plant the cleanup crew is seeking justice. at the same time the trump administration is weakening protections for this toxic pollution. interior s bernhardt helped bury a damning pesticide report the clean air committee goes soft on soot and trump nominates a climate change denier to the fed board. trump s wildfire lies zinke s acronym defense and the epa s forced altruism involving truck pollution. everything you wanted to know about our changing climate but were too afraid to ask. so take it somewhere else says chicago s southeast side. residents who live near the country s busiest ports are getting a new lens on the pollution in their backyards and new tactics to help fight it. nrdc s gina ramirez is helping to bring attention to the wafts of manganese dust that plague her family and neighbors on chicago s southeast side. short answer yes. even a seemingly slight average temperature rise is enough to cause a dramatic transformation of our planet. trump won t sign the g climate commitment pruitt doesn t have time for smog limits and zinke cancels science. as temperatures and carbon levels rise even breathing has become a challenge. here s what you can do to help clear the air. trump rolls back fuel efficiency standards while his epa chief celebrates the country s clean air. scientist kim knowlton monitors the inextricable connections between the planets fragile health and our own. since this giant salty lake in the desert lost its water supply its bird habitat has been shrinking and more toxic dust is wafting up from its dry lake bed. can the salton sea be saved considering making the switch heres everything you need to know about driving electric cars and hybrids. the new proposal would take us backward on climate tilt the grid toward coal and actually kill people. every time you go outside you may be inhaling harmful chemicals. but dont hold your breath. just use your head. so many technological innovations in the automobile industry stem directly from guidelines intended to reduce gas guzzling. if we lose these guidelines we ll also lose a lot of our workforce. roadside plants helped officials trace the source of a public health crisis and led to new standards for clean air in oregon. southeast side residents have been plagued by a heavy metal that s known to negatively impact the brain function of children. a step by step

best way to turn your anger into action is to pick up the phone. follow these tips to minimize your anxiety and maximize your impact. the epa lets states pollute other states air the atlantic coast pipeline fails and fails again to follow the law and ryan zinke actually says the government works for oil companies. but plans to cut local carbon pollution might help this asthma capital shake its wheezy reputation. a recent study found that the state is home to four of the country s most polluting power plants. but elected officials won t even show up to hear their constituents concerns about

natural causes such as forest fires. humans are currently the main contributor to pollution of our planet. for example industrial waste in water bodies damages and disturbs the water life. excess noise from automobiles cities and airplanes causes noise pollution. to learn more about the causes of air pollution specifically see this answer. to learn more about the causes of water pollution specifically see this answer. to learn more about the causes of land pollution specifically see this answer. see below... pollution is harmful material released into the environment. one result of air pollution is acid rain. this occurs when exhaust from industries mixes with moisture in the air. this precipitation then falls as acid rain. it has damaged historic buildings bridges cathedrals and monuments across western europe. over the years acid rain has also damaged forests and freshwater lakes. air pollution occurs when harmful or excessive quantities of substances including gases particulates and biological molecules are introduced into earths atmosphere. it may cause diseases allergies and even death to humans it may also cause harm to other living organisms such as animals and food crops and may damage the natural or built environment. both human activity and natural processes can generate air pollution. indoor air pollution and poor urban air quality are listed as two of the worlds worst toxic pollution problems in the blacksmith institute worlds worst polluted places report. outdoor air pollution alone causes. to. million premature deaths annually. according to the world health organization report air pollution in caused the deaths of around million people worldwide an estimate roughly echoed by the international energy agency. an air pollutant is a material in the air that can have adverse effects on humans and the ecosystem. the substance can be solid particles liquid droplets or gases. a pollutant can be of natural origin or man made. pollutants are classified as primary or secondary. primary pollutants are usually produced by processes such as ash from a volcanic eruption. other examples include carbon monoxide gas from motor vehicle exhausts or sulfur dioxide released from factories. secondary pollutants are not emitted directly. rather they form in the air when primary pollutants react or interact. ground level ozone is a prominent example of secondary pollutants. some pollutants may be both primary and secondary they are both emitted directly and formed from other primary pollutants. pollutants emitted into the atmosphere by human activity include secondary pollutants include minor air pollutants include persistent organic pollutants are organic compounds that are resistant to environmental degradation through chemical biological and photolytic processes. because of this they have been observed to persist in the environment to be capable of long range transport bioaccumulate in human and animal tissue biomagnify in food chains and to have potentially significant impacts on human health and the environment. these are mostly related to the burning of fuel. there are also sources from processes other than combustionair pollutant emission factors are reported representative values that attempt to relate the quantity of a pollutant released to the ambient air with an activity associated with the release of that pollutant. these factors are usually expressed as the weight of pollutant divided by a unit weight volume distance or duration of the activity emitting the pollutant. such factors facilitate estimation of emissions from various sources of air pollution. in most cases these factors are simply averages of all available data of acceptable quality and are generally assumed to be representative of long term averages. there are compounds in the list of persistent organic pollutants. dioxins and furans are two of them and intentionally created by combustion of organics like open burning of plastics. these compounds are also endocrine disruptors and can mutate the human genes. the united states environmental protection agency has published a compilation of air pollutant emission factors for a wide range of industrial sources. the united kingdom australia canada and many other countries have published similar compilations as well as the european environment agency. air pollution risk is a function of the hazard of the pollutant and the exposure to that pollutant. air pollution exposure can be expressed for an individual for certain groups or for entire populations. for example one may want to calculate the exposure to a hazardous air pollutant for a geographic area which includes the various microenvironments and age groups. this can be calculated as an inhalation exposure. this would account for daily exposure in various settings. the exposure needs to include different age and other demographic groups especially infants children pregnant women and other sensitive subpopulations. the exposure to an air pollutant must integrate the concentrations of the air pollutant with respect to the time spent in each setting and the respective inhalation rates for each subgroup for each specific time that the subgroup is in the setting and engaged in particular activities. for example a small childs inhalation rate will be less than that of an adult. a child engaged in vigorous exercise will have a higher respiration rate than the same child in a sedentary activity. the daily exposure then needs to reflect the time spent in each micro environmental setting and the type of activities in these settings. the air pollutant concentration in each microactivity microenvironmental setting is summed to indicate the exposure. for some pollutants such as black carbon traffic related exposures may dominate total exposure despite short exposure times since high concentrations coincide with proximity to major roads or participation to traffic. a large portion of total daily exposure occurs as short peaks of high concentrations but it remains unclear how to define peaks and determine their frequency and health impact. a lack of ventilation indoors concentrates air pollution where people often spend the majority of their time. radon gas a carcinogen is exuded from the earth in certain locations and trapped inside houses. building materials including carpeting and plywood emit formaldehyde gas. paint and solvents give off volatile organic compounds as they dry. lead paint can degenerate into dust and be inhaled. intentional air pollution is introduced with the use of air fresheners incense and other scented items. controlled wood fires in stoves and fireplaces can add significant amounts of smoke particulates into the air inside and out. indoor pollution fatalities may be caused by using pesticides and other chemical sprays indoors without proper ventilation. carbon monoxide poisoning and fatalities are often caused by faulty vents and chimneys or by the burning of charcoal indoors or in a confined space such as a tent. chronic carbon monoxide poisoning can result even from poorly adjusted pilot lights. traps are built into all domestic plumbing to keep sewer gas and hydrogen sulfide out of interiors. clothing emits tetrachloroethylene or other dry cleaning fluids for days after dry cleaning. though its use has now been banned in many countries the extensive use of asbestos in industrial and domestic environments in the past has left a potentially very dangerous material in many localities. asbestosis is a chronic inflammatory medical condition affecting the tissue of the lungs. it occurs after long term heavy exposure to asbestos from asbestos containing materials in structures. sufferers have severe dyspnea and are at an increased risk regarding several different types of lung cancer. as clear explanations are not always stressed in non technical literature care should be taken to distinguish between several forms of relevant diseases. according to the world health organization these may defined as asbestosis lung cancer and peritoneal mesothelioma. biological sources of air pollution are also found indoors as gases and airborne particulates. pets produce dander people produce dust from minute skin flakes and decomposed hair dust mites in bedding carpeting and furniture produce enzymes and micrometre sized fecal droppings inhabitants emit methane mold forms on walls and generates mycotoxins and spores air conditioning systems can incubate legionnaires disease and mold and houseplants soil and surrounding gardens can produce pollen dust and mold. indoors the lack of air circulation allows these airborne pollutants to accumulate more than they would otherwise occur in nature. in air pollution caused premature deaths on average of year in europe and was a significant risk factor for a number of pollution related diseases including respiratory infections heart disease copd stroke and lung cancer. the health effects caused by air pollution may include difficulty in breathing wheezing coughing asthma and worsening of existing respiratory and cardiac conditions. these effects can result in increased medication use increased doctor or emergency department visits more hospital admissions and premature death. the human health effects of poor air quality are far reaching but principally affect the bodys respiratory system and the cardiovascular system. individual reactions to air pollutants depend on the type of pollutant a person is exposed to the degree of exposure and the individuals health status and genetics. the most common sources of air pollution include particulates ozone nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide. children aged less than five years that live in developing countries are the most vulnerable population in terms of total deaths attributable to indoor and outdoor air pollution. the world health organization estimated in that every year air pollution causes the premature death of some million people worldwide. studies published in march indicated that the number may be around. million. india has the highest death rate due to air pollution. india also has more deaths from asthma than any other nation according to the world health organization. in december air pollution was estimated to kill people in china each year. there is a positive correlation between pneumonia related deaths and air pollution from motor vehicle emissions. annual premature european deaths caused by air pollution are estimated at an important cause of these deaths is nitrogen dioxide and other nitrogen oxides emitted by road vehicles. in a consultation document the uk government disclosed that nitrogen dioxide is responsible for premature uk deaths per annum. across the european union air pollution is estimated to reduce life expectancy by almost nine months. causes of deaths include strokes heart disease copd lung cancer and lung infections. urban outdoor air pollution is estimated to cause. million deaths worldwide per year. children are particularly at risk due to the immaturity of their respiratory organ systems. the us epa estimated in that a proposed set of changes in diesel engine technology could result in fewer premature mortalities fewer heart attacks fewer emergency department visits by children with asthma and fewer respiratory related hospital admissions each year in the united states. the us epa has estimated that limiting ground level ozone concentration to parts per billion would avert to premature deaths nationwide in compared with the ppb standard. the agency projected the more protective standard would also prevent an additional cases of aggravated asthma and more than a million cases of missed work or school. following this assessment the epa acted to protect public health by lowering the national ambient air quality standards for ground level ozone to parts per billion. a new economic study of the health impacts and associated costs of air pollution in the los angeles basin and san joaquin valley of southern california shows that more than people die prematurely each year because air pollution levels violate federal standards. the number of annual premature deaths is considerably higher than the fatalities related to auto collisions in the same area which average fewer than per year. diesel exhaust is a major contributor to combustion derived particulate matter air pollution. in several human experimental studies using a well validated exposure chamber setup de has been linked to acute vascular dysfunction and increased thrombus formation. the mechanisms linking air pollution to increased cardiovascular mortality are uncertain but probably include pulmonary and systemic inflammation. a review of evidence found that ambient air pollution exposure is a risk factor correlating with increased total mortality from cardiovascular events. air pollution is also emerging as a risk factor for stroke particularly in developing countries where pollutant levels are highest. a study found that in women air pollution is not associated with hemorrhagic but with ischemic stroke. air pollution was also found to be associated with increased incidence and mortality from coronary stroke in a cohort study in. associations are believed to be causal and effects may be mediated by vasoconstriction low grade inflammation and atherosclerosis other mechanisms such as autonomic nervous system imbalance have also been suggested. research has demonstrated increased risk of developing asthma and copd from increased exposure to traffic related air pollution. additionally air pollution has been associated with increased hospitalization and mortality from asthma and copd. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease includes diseases such as chronic bronchitis and emphysema. a study conducted in in the wake of the great smog of compared london residents with residents of gloucester peterborough and norwich three towns with low reported death rates from chronic bronchitis. all subjects were male postal truck drivers aged to. compared to the subjects from the outlying towns the london subjects exhibited more severe respiratory symptoms reduced lung function and increased sputum production and purulence. the differences were more pronounced for subjects aged to. the study controlled for age and smoking habits so concluded that air pollution was the most likely cause of the observed differences. more recent studies have shown that air pollution exposure from traffic reduces lung function development in children and lung function may be compromised by air pollution even at low concentrations. air pollution exposure also cause lung cancer in non smokers. it is believed that much like cystic fibrosis by living in a more urban environment serious health hazards become more apparent. studies have shown that in urban areas patients suffer mucus hypersecretion lower levels of lung function and more self diagnosis of chronic bronchitis and emphysema. a review of evidence regarding whether ambient air pollution exposure is a risk factor for cancer in found solid data to conclude that long term exposure to pm. increases the overall risk of non accidental mortality by per a microg m increase. exposure to pm. was also associated with an increased risk of mortality from lung cancer and total cardiovascular mortality. the review further noted that living close to busy traffic appears to be associated with elevated risks of these three outcomes increase in lung cancer deaths cardiovascular deaths and overall non accidental deaths. the reviewers also found suggestive evidence that exposure to pm. is positively associated with mortality from coronary heart diseases and exposure to so increases mortality from lung cancer but the data was insufficient to provide solid conclusions. another investigation showed that higher activity level increases deposition fraction of aerosol particles in human lung and recommended avoiding heavy activities like running in outdoor space at polluted areas. in a large danish epidemiological study found an increased risk of lung cancer for patients who lived in areas with high nitrogen oxide concentrations. in this study the association was higher for non smokers than smokers. an additional danish study also in likewise noted evidence of possible associations between air pollution and other forms of cancer including cervical cancer and brain cancer. in december medical scientists reported that cancer is overwhelmingly a result of environmental factors and not largely down to bad luck. maintaining a healthy weight eating a healthy diet minimizing alcohol and eliminating smoking reduces the risk of developing the disease according to the researchers. in the united states despite the passage of the clean air act in in at least million americans were living in non attainment areasregions in which the concentration of certain air pollutants exceeded federal standards. these dangerous pollutants are known as the criteria pollutants and include ozone particulate matter sulfur dioxide nitrogen dioxide carbon monoxide and lead. protective measures to ensure childrens health are being taken in cities such as new delhi india where buses now use compressed natural gas to help eliminate the pea soup smog. a recent study in europe has found that exposure to ultrafine particles can increase blood pressure in children. according to a who report polluted air is a main cause poisoning millions of children under the age of years and ruining their lives which resulting to death of some six hundred thousand children annually. ambient levels of air pollution have been associated with preterm birth and low birth weight. a who worldwide survey on maternal and perinatal health found a statistically significant association between low birth weights and increased levels of exposure to pm.. women in regions with greater than average pm. levels had statistically significant higher odds of pregnancy resulting in a low birth weight infant even when adjusted for country related variables. the effect is thought to be from stimulating inflammation and increasing oxidative stress. a study by the university of york found that in exposure to pm. was strongly associated with of preterm births globally which was approximately. million premature births. the countries with the highest air pollution associated preterm births were in south and east asia the middle east north africa and west sub saharan africa. the source of pm. differs greatly by region. in south and east asia pregnant women are frequently exposed to indoor air pollution because of the wood and other biomass fuels used for cooking which are responsible for more than of regional pollution. in the middle east north africa and west sub saharan africa fine pm comes from natural sources such as dust storms. the united states had an estimated preterm births associated with exposure to pm. in. a study performed by wang et al. between the years of and has found a correlation between sulfur dioxide and total suspended particulates and preterm births and low birth weights in beijing. a group of pregnant women in four separate regions of beijing were monitored from early pregnancy to delivery along with daily air pollution levels of sulfur dioxide and tsp. the estimated reduction in birth weight was. g for every g m increase in so and. g for each g m increase in tsp. these associations were statistically significant in both summer and winter although summer was greater. the proportion of low birth weight attributable to air pollution was. this is the largest attributable risk ever reported for the known risk factors of low birth weight. coal stoves which are in of homes are a major source of air pollution in this area. brauer et al. studied the relationship between air pollution and proximity to a highway with pregnancy outcomes in a vancouver cohort of pregnant woman using addresses to estimate exposure during pregnancy. exposure to no no co pm and pm. were associated with infants born small for gestational age. women living meters away from an expressway or highway were more likely to give birth to a sga infant. even in the areas with relatively low levels of air pollution public health effects can be significant and costly since a large number of people breathe in such pollutants. a study published in found that even in areas of the u. s. where ozone and pm. meet federal standards medicare recipients who are exposed to more air pollution have higher mortality rates. a scientific study for the british columbia lung association showed that a small improvement in air quality would produce million in annual savings in the metro vancouver region in. this finding is based on health valuation of lethal and sub lethal affects. data is accumulating that air pollution exposure also affects the central nervous system. in a june study conducted by researchers at the university of rochester medical center published in the journal environmental health perspectives it was discovered that early exposure to air pollution causes the same damaging changes in the brain as autism and schizophrenia. the study also shows that air pollution also affected short term memory learning ability and impulsivity. lead researcher professor deborah cory slechta said that when we looked closely at the ventricles we could see that the white matter that normally surrounds them hadnt fully developed. it appears that inflammation had damaged those brain cells and prevented that region of the brain from developing and the ventricles simply expanded to fill the space. our findings add to the growing body of evidence that air pollution may play a role in autism as well as in other neurodevelopmental disorders. in a study of mice air pollution also has a more significant negative effect on males than on females. in experimental studies reported the detection of significant episodic cognitive impairment from impurities in indoor air breathed by test subjects who were not informed about changes in the air quality. researchers at the harvard university and suny upstate medical university and syracuse university measured the cognitive performance of participants in three different controlled laboratory atmospheres that simulated those found in conventional and green buildings as well as green buildings with enhanced ventilation. performance was evaluated objectively using the widely used strategic management simulation software simulation tool which is a well validated assessment test for executive decision making in an unconstrained situation allowing initiative and improvisation. significant deficits were observed in the performance scores achieved in increasing concentrations of either volatile organic compounds or carbon dioxide while keeping other factors constant. the highest impurity levels reached are not uncommon in some classroom or office environments. air pollution increases the risk of dementia in people over years old. in india in it was reported that air pollution by black carbon and ground level ozone had reduced crop yields in the most affected areas by almost half in when compared to levels. air pollution costs the world economy trillion per year as a result of productivity losses and degraded quality of life according to a joint study by the world bank and the institute for health metrics and evaluation at the university of washington. these productivity losses are caused by deaths due to diseases caused by air pollution. one out of ten deaths in was caused by diseases associated with air pollution and the problem is getting worse. the problem is even more acute in the developing world. children under age in lower income countries are more than times as likely to die from exposure to air pollution as children in high income countries. the report states that additional economic losses caused by air pollution including health costs and the adverse effect on agricultural and other productivity were not calculated in the report and thus the actual costs to the world economy are far higher than trillion. the worlds worst short term civilian pollution crisis was the bhopal disaster in india. leaked industrial vapours from the union carbide factory belonging to union carbide inc. u. s. a. killed at least people and injured from to. the united kingdom suffered its worst air pollution event when the december great smog of formed over london. in six days more than died and more recent estimates put the figure at nearer. an accidental leak of anthrax spores from a biological warfare laboratory in the former ussr in near sverdlovsk is believed to have caused at least deaths. the worst single incident of air pollution to occur in the us occurred in donora pennsylvania in late october when people died and over were injured. there are now practical alternatives to the principal causes of air pollution various air pollution control technologies and strategies are available to reduce air pollution. at its most basic level land use planning is likely to involve zoning and transport infrastructure planning. in most developed countries land use planning is an important part of social policy ensuring that land is used efficiently for the benefit of the wider economy and population as well as to protect the environment. because a large share of air pollution is caused by combustion of fossil fuels such as coal and oil the reduction of these fuels can reduce air pollution drastically. most effective is the switch to clean power sources such as wind power solar power hydro power which dont cause air pollution. efforts to reduce pollution from mobile sources includes primary regulation expanding regulation to new sources increased fuel efficiency conversion to cleaner fuels or conversion to electric vehicles. titanium dioxide has been researched for its ability to reduce air pollution. ultraviolet light will release free electrons from material thereby creating free radicals which break up vocs and nox gases. one form is superhydrophilic. in prof. tony ryan and prof. simon armitage of university of sheffield prepared a meter by meter sized poster coated with microscopic pollution eating nanoparticles of titanium dioxide. placed on a building this giant poster can absorb the toxic emission from around cars each day. a very effective means to reduce air pollution is the transition to renewable energy. according to a study published in energy and environmental science in the switch to renewable energy in the united states would eliminate about premature mortalities per year and about in if no biomass were used. this would save about billion in health costs a year due to reduced air pollution in or about. of the u. s. gross domestic product. the following items are commonly used as pollution control devices in industry and transportation. they can either destroy contaminants or remove them from an exhaust stream before it is emitted into the atmosphere. in general there are two types of air quality standards. the first class of standards set maximum atmospheric concentrations for specific pollutants. environmental agencies enact regulations which are intended to result in attainment of these target levels. the second class take the form of a scale with various thresholds which is used to communicate to the public the relative risk of outdoor activity. the scale may or may not distinguish between different pollutants. in canada air pollution and associated health risks are measured with the air quality health index or. it is a health protection tool used to make decisions to reduce short term exposure to air pollution by adjusting activity levels during increased levels of air pollution. the air quality health index or aqhi is a federal program jointly coordinated by health canada and environment canada. however the aqhi program would not be possible without the commitment and support of the provinces municipalities and ngos. from air quality monitoring to health risk communication and community engagement local partners are responsible for the vast majority of work related to aqhi implementation. the aqhi provides a number from to to indicate the level of health risk associated with local air quality. occasionally when the amount of air pollution is abnormally high the number may exceed. the aqhi provides a local air quality current value as well as a local air quality maximums forecast for today tonight and tomorrow and provides associated health advice. as it is now known that even low levels of air pollution can trigger discomfort for the sensitive population the index has been developed as a continuum the higher the number the greater the health risk and need to take precautions. the index describes the level of health risk associated with this number as low moderate high or very high and suggests steps that can be taken to reduce exposure. the measurement is based on the observed relationship of nitrogen dioxide ground level ozone and particulates with mortality from an analysis of several canadian cities. significantly all three of these pollutants can pose health risks even at low levels of exposure especially among those with pre existing health problems. when developing the aqhi health canadas original analysis of health effects included five major air pollutants particulates ozone and nitrogen dioxide as well as sulfur dioxide and carbon monoxide. the latter two pollutants provided little information in predicting health effects and were removed from the aqhi formulation. the aqhi does not measure the effects of odour pollen dust heat or humidity. ta luft is the german air quality regulation. air pollution hotspots are areas where air pollution emissions expose individuals to increased negative health effects. they are particularly common in highly populated urban areas where there may be a combination of stationary sources and mobile sources of pollution. emissions from these sources can cause respiratory disease childhood asthma cancer and other health problems. fine particulate matter such as diesel soot which contributes to more than. million premature deaths around the world each year is a significant problem. it is very small and can lodge itself within the lungs and enter the bloodstream. diesel soot is concentrated in densely populated areas and one in six people in the u. s. live near a diesel pollution hot spot. while air pollution hotspots affect a variety of populations some groups are more likely to be located in hotspots. previous studies have shown disparities in exposure to pollution by race and or income. hazardous land uses tend to be located where property values and income levels are low. low socioeconomic status can be a proxy for other kinds of social vulnerability including race a lack of ability to influence regulation and a lack of ability to move to neighborhoods with less environmental pollution. these communities bear a disproportionate burden of environmental pollution and are more likely to face health risks such as cancer or asthma. studies show that patterns in race and income disparities not only indicate a higher exposure to pollution but also higher risk of adverse health outcomes. communities characterized by low socioeconomic status and racial minorities can be more vulnerable to cumulative adverse health impacts resulting from elevated exposure to pollutants than more privileged communities. blacks and latinos generally face more pollution than whites and asians and low income communities bear a higher burden of risk than affluent ones. racial discrepancies are particularly distinct in suburban areas of the southern united states and metropolitan areas of the midwestern and western united states. residents in public housing who are generally low income and can not move to healthier neighborhoods are highly affected by nearby refineries and chemical plants. air pollution is usually concentrated in densely populated metropolitan areas especially in developing countries where environmental regulations are relatively lax or nonexistent. however even populated areas in developed countries attain unhealthy levels of pollution with los angeles and rome being two examples. between and the incidence of lung cancer in beijing near doubled. while smoking remains the leading cause of lung cancer in china the number of smokers is falling while lung cancer rates are rising. in europe council directive ec on ambient air quality assessment and management provides a common strategy against which member states can set objectives for ambient air quality in order to avoid prevent or reduce harmful effects on human health and the environment... and improve air quality where it is unsatisfactory. on july in the case dieter janecek v freistaat bayern curia the european court of justice ruled that under this directive citizens have the right to require national authorities to implement a short term action plan that aims to maintain or achieve compliance to air quality limit values. this important case law appears to confirm the role of the ec as centralised regulator to european nation states as regards air pollution control. it places a supranational legal obligation on the uk to protect its citizens from dangerous levels of air pollution furthermore superseding national interests with those of the citizen. in the european commission threatened the uk with legal action against the successive breaching of pm limit values. the uk government has identified that if fines are imposed they could cost the nation upwards of million per year. in march the greater london built up area remains the only uk region in breach of the ecs limit values and has been given months to implement an emergency action plan aimed at meeting the eu air quality directive. the city of london has dangerous levels of pm concentrations estimated to cause deaths per year within the city. as well as the threat of eu fines in it was threatened with legal action for scrapping the western congestion charge zone which is claimed to have led to an increase in air pollution levels. in response to these charges boris johnson mayor of london has criticised the current need for european cities to communicate with europe through their nation states central government arguing that in future a great city like london should be permitted to bypass its government and deal directly with the european commission regarding its air quality action plan. this can be interpreted as recognition that cities can transcend the traditional national government organisational hierarchy and develop solutions to air pollution using global governance networks for example through transnational relations. transnational relations include but are not exclusive to national governments and intergovernmental organisations allowing sub national actors including cities and regions to partake in air pollution control as independent actors. particularly promising at present are global city partnerships. these can be built into networks for example the c cities climate leadership group of which london is a member. the c is a public non state network of the worlds leading cities that aims to curb their greenhouse emissions. the c has been identified as governance from the middle and is an alternative to intergovernmental policy. it has the potential to improve urban air quality as participating cities exchange information learn from best practices and consequently mitigate carbon dioxide emissions independently from national government decisions. a criticism of the c network is that its exclusive nature limits influence to participating cities and risks drawing resources away from less powerful city and regional actors. click here to sign in with or forget password learn moreshare this twitshareemail april by matt williams universe today by definition pollution refers to any matter that is out of place. in other words it is what happens when toxins contaminants and other harmful products are introduced into an environment disrupting its normal patterns and functions. when it comes to our atmosphere

term effect they can have. by composition earths atmosphere is made up of nitrogen gas oxygen gas and other trace gases. this balance is essential to all life here on earth so the introduction of pollutants can have a profound and damaging effect. all told pollution can take many forms like carbon compounds such as carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. sulfuric compounds like sulfur dioxide methane radioactive decay or toxic chemicals. in addition air pollution can be divided into primary and secondary types of pollutants. whereas primary pollutants are caused by primary sources i. e. the direct result of processes secondary pollutants are the results of intermingling and reactions by primary pollutants. natural causes human activity is a major cause of air pollution much of which results from industrial processes. credit cherwell. org natural forms of pollution are those that result from naturally occurring phenomena. this means they are caused by periodic activities that are

earths natural climatic variations also means that they are sustainable over long periods of time. dust and wildfires in large areas of open land that have little to no vegetation and are particularly dry due to a lack of precipitation wind can naturally create dust storms. this particulate matter when added to the air can have a natural warming effect and can also be a health hazard for living creatures. particulate matter when scattered into regions that have natural vegetation can also be a natural impediment to photosynthesis. wildfires are a natural occurrence in wooded areas when prolonged dry periods occur generally as a result of season changes and a lack of precipitation. the smoke and carbon monoxide caused by these fires contribute to carbon levels in the atmosphere which allows for greater warming by causing a greenhouse effect. animal and vegetation the chiwaukum fire in washington state in. credit washington dnr flickr animal digestion is another cause of natural air pollution leading to the release of methane another greenhouse gas. in some regions of the world vegetation such as black gum poplar oak and willow trees emits significant amounts of volatile organic compounds on warmer days. these react with primary anthropogenic pollutants specifically nitrogen oxides sulfur dioxide and carbon compounds to produce low lying seasonal hazes that are rich in ozone. volcanic activity volcanic eruptions are a major source of natural air pollution. when an eruption occurs it produces tremendous amounts of sulfuric chlorine and ash products which are released into the atmosphere and can be picked up by winds to be dispersed over large areas. additionally compounds like sulfur dioxide and volcanic ash have been known to have a natural cooling effect due to their ability to reflect solar radiation. anthropogenic causes but by far the greatest contributing to air pollution today are those that are a result of human impact i. e. man made causes. these are largely the result of human reliance on fossil fuels and heavy industry but can also be due to the accumulation of waste modern agriculture and other man made processes. fossil fuel emissions emissions by vehicles are a major cause of anthropogenic air pollution. credit ucsusa. org the combustion of fossil fuels like coal petroleum and other factory combustibles is a major cause of air pollution. these are generally used in power plants manufacturing facilities and waste incinerators as well as furnaces and other types of fuel burning heating devices. providing air conditioning and other services also requires significant amounts of electricity which in turn leads to more emissions. according to the union of concerned scientists industry accounts for of greenhouse gas emissions in the us while electricity generation accounted for another. meanwhile emissions caused by gasoline burning vehicles i. e. co co nitrogen oxides particulates and water vapor are also a significant source of air pollution. a study conducted by the ucs in showed that transportation accounted for more than half of the carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides and almost a quarter

combination of factors one is the production of methane by cattle. another cause is deforestation where the need for pastureland and growing fields requires the removal of trees that would otherwise sequester carbon and clean the air. according to the ipcc fifth assessment report agriculture accounts for of annual emissions. however this estimate does not include the co that ecosystems remove from the atmosphere by sequestering carbon in biomass dead organic matter and soils which offset approximately of emissions from this sector. waste landfills are also known to generate methane which is not only a major greenhouse gas but also an asphyxiant and highly flammable and potentially hazardous if a landfills grow unchecked. population growth and urbanization have a proportional relationship with the production of waste which in turn leads to greater demand for dumping grounds that are far removed from urban environments. these locations thus became a significant source of methane production. for some time environmental scientists have been aware that the earth has several self regulating mechanisms. when it comes to the earths atmosphere these mechanisms allow for the sequestration of carbon and other pollutants ensuring that the balance of its ecosystem remains unaffected. unfortunately the growing impact humanity has had on the planet is threatening to permanently alter that balance. basically we are adding pollutants to the air faster than the earths natural mechanisms can remove them. ad the results of this are being felt in terms of acid rain

human activities. water bodies include for example lakes rivers oceans aquifers and groundwater. water pollution results when contaminants are introduced into the natural environment. for example releasing inadequately treated wastewater into natural water bodies can lead to degradation of aquatic ecosystems. in turn this can lead to public health problems for people living downstream. they may use the same polluted river water for drinking or bathing or irrigation. water pollution is the leading worldwide cause of death and disease e. g. due to water borne diseases. water pollution can be grouped into surface water pollution. marine pollution and nutrient pollution are subsets of water pollution. sources of water pollution are either point sources and non point sources. point sources have one identifiable cause of the pollution such as a storm drain wastewater treatment plant or stream. non point sources are more diffuse such as agricultural runoff. pollution is the result of the cumulative effect over time. all plants and organisms living in or being exposed to polluted water bodies can be impacted. the effects can damage individual species and impact the natural biological communities they are part of. the causes of water pollution include a wide range of chemicals and pathogens as well as physical parameters. contaminants may include organic and inorganic substances. elevated temperatures can also lead to polluted water. a common cause of thermal pollution is the use of water as a coolant by power plants and industrial manufacturers. elevated water temperatures decrease oxygen levels which can kill fish and alter food chain composition reduce species biodiversity and foster invasion by new thermophilic species. water pollution is measured by analysing water samples. physical chemical and biological tests can be done. control of water pollution requires appropriate infrastructure and management plans. the infrastructure may include wastewater treatment plants. sewage treatment plants and industrial wastewater treatment plants are usually required to protect water bodies from untreated wastewater. agricultural wastewater treatment for farms and erosion control from construction sites can also help prevent water pollution. nature based solutions are another approach to prevent water pollution. effective control of urban runoff includes reducing speed and quantity of flow. in the united states best management practices for water pollution include approaches to reduce the quantity of water and improve water quality. water is typically referred to as polluted when it is impaired by anthropogenic contaminants. due to these contaminants it either does not support a human use such as drinking water or undergoes a marked shift in its ability to support its biotic communities such as fish. natural phenomena such as volcanoes algae blooms storms and earthquakes also cause major changes in water quality and the ecological status of water. water pollution is a major global problem. it requires ongoing evaluation and revision of water resource policy at all levels. it has been suggested that water pollution is the leading worldwide cause of death and diseases. water pollution accounted for the deaths of. million people in. the organization global oceanic environmental survey consider water pollution as one of the main environmental problems that can present a danger for the existence of life on earth in the next decades. one of the main concerns is that water pollution heart phytoplankton who produce of oxygen and remove a large part of carbon dioxide on earth. the organization proposes a number of measures for fixing the situation but they should be taken in the next years for being effective. india and china are two countries with high levels of water pollution an estimated people in india die of water pollution related illness every day. about percent of the water in the cities of china is polluted. as of half a billion chinese had no access to safe drinking water. in addition to the acute problems of water pollution in developing countries developed countries also continue to struggle with pollution problems. for example in a report on water quality in the united states in percent of assessed stream miles percent of assessed lake acres and percent of assessed bays and estuarine square miles were classified as polluted. surface water pollution includes pollution of rivers lakes and oceans. a subset of surface water pollution is marine pollution. one common path of entry by contaminants to the sea are rivers. an example is directly discharging sewage and industrial waste into the ocean. pollution such as this occurs particularly in developing nations. in fact the largest emitters of oceanic plastic pollution worldwide are from the most to the least china indonesia philippines vietnam sri lanka thailand egypt malaysia nigeria and bangladesh largely through the rivers yangtze indus yellow hai nile ganges pearl amur niger and the mekong and accounting for percent of all the plastic that reaches the worlds oceans. large gyres in the oceans trap floating plastic debris. plastic debris can absorb toxic chemicals from ocean pollution potentially poisoning any creature that eats it. many of these long lasting pieces end up in the stomachs of marine birds and animals. this results in obstruction of digestive pathways which leads to reduced appetite or even starvation. there are a variety of secondary effects stemming not from the original pollutant but a derivative condition. an example is silt bearing surface runoff which can inhibit the penetration of sunlight through the water column hampering photosynthesis in aquatic plants. interactions between groundwater and surface water are complex. consequently groundwater pollution also referred to as groundwater contamination is not as easily classified as surface water pollution. by its very nature groundwater aquifers are susceptible to contamination from sources that may not directly affect surface water bodies. the distinction of point vs. non point source may be irrelevant. analysis of groundwater contamination may focus on soil characteristics and site geology hydrogeology hydrology and the nature of the contaminants. causes of groundwater pollution include naturally occurring on site sanitation systems sewage fertilizers and pesticide commercial and industrial leaks hydraulic fracturing landfill leachate. surface water and groundwater have often been studied and managed as separate resources even though they are interrelated. surface water seeps through the soil and becomes groundwater. conversely groundwater can also feed surface water sources. sources of surface water pollution are generally grouped into two categories based on their origin. point source water pollution refers to contaminants that enter a waterway from a single identifiable source such as a pipe or ditch. examples of sources in this category include discharges from a sewage treatment plant a factory or a city storm drain. the u. s. clean water act defines point source for regulatory enforcement purposes. the cwa definition of point source was amended in to include municipal storm sewer systems as well as industrial storm water such as from construction sites. nonpoint source pollution refers to diffuse contamination that does not originate from a single discrete source. this type of pollution is often the cumulative effect of small amounts of contaminants gathered from a large area. a common example is the leaching out of nitrogen compounds from fertilized agricultural lands. nutrient runoff in storm water from sheet flow over an agricultural field or a forest are also cited as examples of non point source pollution. contaminated storm water washed off of parking lots roads and highways called urban runoff is sometimes included under the category of non point sources. this runoff becomes a point source because it is typically channeled into storm drain systems and discharged through pipes to local surface waters. the specific contaminants leading to pollution in water include a wide spectrum of chemicals pathogens and physical changes such as elevated temperature and discoloration. while many of the chemicals and substances that are regulated may be naturally occurring the concentration usually determines what is a natural component of water and what is a contaminant. high concentrations of naturally occurring substances can have negative impacts on aquatic flora and fauna. oxygen depleting substances may be natural materials such as plant matter as well as man made chemicals. other natural and anthropogenic substances may cause turbidity which blocks light and disrupts plant growth and clogs the gills of some fish species. alteration of waters physical chemistry includes acidity electrical conductivity temperature and eutrophication. eutrophication is an increase in the concentration of chemical nutrients in an ecosystem to an extent that increases the primary productivity of the ecosystem. depending on the degree of eutrophication subsequent negative environmental effects such as anoxia and severe reductions in water quality may occur affecting fish and other animal populations. disease causing microorganisms are referred to as pathogens. pathogens can produce waterborne diseases in either human or animal hosts. coliform bacteria which are not an actual cause of disease are commonly used as a bacterial indicator of water pollution. other microorganisms sometimes found in contaminated surface waters that have caused human health problems include high levels of pathogens may result from on site sanitation systems or inadequately treated sewage discharges. older cities with ageing infrastructure may have leaky sewage collection systems which can cause sanitary sewer overflows. some cities also have combined sewers which may discharge untreated sewage during rain storms. silt from sewage discharges also pollutes water bodies. pathogen discharges may also be caused by poorly managed livestock operations. contaminants may include organic and inorganic substances. many of the chemical substances are toxic. organic water pollutants include inorganic water pollutants include macroscopic pollution large visible items polluting the water may be termed floatables in an urban storm water context or marine debris when found on the open seas and can include such items as thermal pollution is the rise or fall in the temperature of a natural body of water caused by human influence. thermal pollution unlike chemical pollution results in a change in the physical properties of water. a common cause of thermal pollution is the use of water as a coolant by power plants and industrial manufacturers. elevated water temperatures decrease oxygen levels which can kill fish and alter food chain composition reduce species biodiversity and foster invasion by new thermophilic species. urban runoff may also elevate temperature in surface waters. thermal pollution can also be caused by the release of very cold water from the base of reservoirs into warmer rivers. water pollution may be analyzed through several broad categories of methods physical chemical and biological. most involve collection of samples followed by specialized analytical tests. some methods may be conducted in situ without sampling such as temperature. government agencies and research organizations have published standardized validated analytical test methods to facilitate the comparability of results from disparate testing events. sampling of water for physical or chemical testing can be done by several methods depending on the accuracy needed and the characteristics of the contaminant. many contamination events are sharply restricted in time most commonly in association with rain events. for this reason grab samples are often inadequate for fully quantifying contaminant levels. scientists gathering this type of data often employ auto sampler devices that pump increments of water at either time or discharge intervals. sampling for biological testing involves collection of plants and animals from the surface water body. depending on the type of assessment the organisms may be identified for biosurveys and returned to the water body or they may be dissected for bioassays to determine toxicity. common physical tests of water include temperature solids concentrations and turbidity. water samples may be examined using the principles of analytical chemistry. many published test methods are available for both organic and inorganic compounds. frequently used methods include ph biochemical oxygen demand chemical oxygen demand nutrients metals oil and grease total petroleum hydrocarbons and pesticides. biological testing involves the use of plant animal or microbial indicators to monitor the health of an aquatic ecosystem. they are any biological species or group of species whose function population or status can reveal what degree of ecosystem or environmental integrity is present. one example of a group of bio indicators are the copepods and other small water crustaceans that are present in many water bodies. such organisms can be monitored for changes that may indicate a problem within their ecosystem. in urban areas of developed countries municipal wastewater is typically treated by centralized sewage treatment plants. well designed and operated systems can remove percent or more of the pollutant load in sewage. some plants have additional systems to remove nutrients and pathogens but these more advanced treatment steps get progressively more expensive. nature based solutions are also being used instead of centralized treatment plants. cities with sanitary sewer overflows or combined sewer overflows employ one or more engineering approaches to reduce discharges of untreated sewage including households or businesses not served by a municipal treatment plant may have an individual septic tank which pre treats the wastewater on site and infiltrates it into the soil. this can lead to groundwater pollution if not properly done. globally about. billion people currently do not have safely managed sanitation according to an estimate by the joint monitoring programme for water supply and sanitation. lack of access to sanitation often leads to water pollution e. g. via the practice of open defecation during rain events or floods the human feces are moved from the ground where they were deposited into surface waters. simple pit latrines may also get flooded during rain events. the use of safely managed sanitation services would prevent this type of water pollution. some industrial facilities generate wastewater that is similar to domestic sewage and can be treated by sewage treatment plants. industries that generate wastewater with high concentrations of organic matter toxic pollutants or nutrients such as ammonia need specialized treatment systems. ch. some industries install a pre treatment system to remove some pollutants and then discharge the partially treated wastewater to the municipal sewer system. ch. industries generating large volumes of wastewater typically operate their own treatment systems. some industries have been successful at redesigning their manufacturing processes to reduce or eliminate pollutants through a process called pollution prevention. to remove heat from wastewater generated by power plants or manufacturing plants the following technologies are used non point source controlssediment washed off fields is the largest source of agricultural pollution in the united states. farmers may utilize erosion controls to reduce runoff flows and retain soil on their fields. common techniques include contour plowing crop mulching crop rotation planting perennial crops and installing riparian buffers. pp. nutrients are typically applied to farmland as commercial fertilizer animal manure or spraying of municipal or industrial wastewater or sludge. nutrients may also enter runoff from crop residues irrigation water wildlife and atmospheric deposition. p. farmers can develop and implement nutrient management plans to reduce excess application of nutrients pp. and reduce the potential for nutrient pollution. to minimize pesticide impacts farmers may use integrated pest management techniques to maintain control over pests reduce reliance on chemical pesticides and protect water quality. point source wastewater treatmentfarms with large livestock and poultry operations such as factory farms are called concentrated animal feeding operations or feedlots in the us and are being subject to increasing government regulation. animal slurries are usually treated by containment in anaerobic lagoons before disposal by spray or trickle application to grassland. constructed wetlands are sometimes used to facilitate treatment of animal wastes. some animal slurries are treated by mixing with straw and composted at high temperature to produce a bacteriologically sterile and friable manure for soil improvement. sediment from construction sites is managed by installation of discharge of toxic chemicals such as motor fuels and concrete washout is prevented by use of effective control of urban runoff involves reducing the velocity and flow of storm water as well as reducing pollutant discharges. local governments use a variety of storm water management techniques to reduce the effects of urban runoff. these techniques called best management practices for water pollution in the u. s. may focus on water quantity control while others focus on improving water quality and some perform both functions. pollution prevention practices include low impact development techniques installation of green roofs and improved

contamination of water bodies usually as a result of human activities. water bodies include for example lakes rivers oceans aquifers and groundwater. water pollution results when contaminants are introduced into the natural environment. for example releasing inadequately treated wastewater into natural water bodies can lead to degradation of aquatic ecosystems. in turn this can lead to public health problems for people living downstream. they may use the same polluted river water for drinking or bathing or irrigation. water pollution is the leading worldwide cause of death and disease e. g. due to water borne diseases. water pollution can be grouped into surface water pollution. marine pollution and nutrient pollution are subsets of water pollution. sources of water pollution are either point sources and non point sources. point sources have one identifiable cause of the pollution such as a storm drain wastewater treatment plant or stream. non point sources are more diffuse such as agricultural runoff. pollution is the result of the cumulative effect over time. all plants and organisms living in or being exposed to polluted water bodies can be impacted. the effects can damage individual species and impact the natural biological communities they are part of. the causes of water pollution include a wide range of chemicals and pathogens as well as physical parameters. contaminants may include organic and inorganic substances. elevated temperatures can also lead to polluted water. a common cause of thermal pollution is the use of water as a coolant by power plants and industrial manufacturers. elevated water temperatures decrease oxygen levels which can kill fish and alter food chain composition reduce species biodiversity and foster invasion by new thermophilic species. water pollution is measured by analysing water samples. physical chemical and biological tests can be done. control of water pollution requires appropriate infrastructure and management plans. the infrastructure may include wastewater treatment plants. sewage treatment plants and industrial wastewater treatment plants are usually required to protect water bodies from untreated wastewater. agricultural wastewater treatment for farms and erosion control from construction sites can also help prevent water pollution. nature based solutions are another approach to prevent water pollution. effective control of urban runoff includes reducing speed and quantity of flow. in the united states best management practices for water pollution include approaches to reduce the quantity of water and improve water quality. water is typically referred to as polluted when it is impaired by anthropogenic contaminants. due to these contaminants it either does not support a human use such as drinking water or undergoes a marked shift in its ability to support its biotic communities such as fish. natural phenomena such as volcanoes algae blooms storms and earthquakes also cause major changes in water quality and the ecological status of water. water pollution is a major global problem. it requires ongoing evaluation and revision of water resource policy at all levels. it has been suggested that water pollution is the leading worldwide cause of death and diseases. water pollution accounted for the deaths of. million people in. the organization global oceanic environmental survey consider water pollution as one of the main environmental problems that can present a danger for the existence of life on earth in the next decades. one of the main concerns is that water pollution heart phytoplankton who produce of oxygen and remove a large part of carbon dioxide on earth. the organization proposes a number of measures for fixing the situation but they should be taken in the next years for being effective. india and china are two countries with high levels of water pollution an estimated people in india die of water pollution related illness every day. about percent of the water in the cities of china is polluted. as of half a billion chinese had no access to safe drinking water. in addition to the acute problems of water pollution in developing countries developed countries also continue to struggle with pollution problems. for example in a report on water quality in the united states in percent of assessed stream miles percent of assessed lake acres and percent of assessed bays and estuarine square miles were classified as polluted. surface water pollution includes pollution of rivers lakes and oceans. a subset of surface water pollution is marine pollution. one common path of entry by contaminants to the sea are rivers. an example is directly discharging sewage and industrial waste into the ocean. pollution such as this occurs particularly in developing nations. in fact the largest emitters of oceanic plastic pollution worldwide are from the most to the least china indonesia philippines vietnam sri lanka thailand egypt malaysia nigeria and bangladesh largely through the rivers yangtze indus yellow hai nile ganges pearl amur niger and the mekong and accounting for percent of all the plastic that reaches the worlds oceans. large gyres in the oceans trap floating plastic debris. plastic debris can absorb toxic chemicals from ocean pollution potentially poisoning any creature that eats it. many of these long lasting pieces end up in the stomachs of marine birds and animals. this results in obstruction of digestive pathways which leads to reduced appetite or even starvation. there are a variety of secondary effects stemming not from the original pollutant but a derivative condition. an example is silt bearing surface runoff which can inhibit the penetration of sunlight through the water column hampering photosynthesis in aquatic plants. interactions between groundwater and surface water are complex. consequently groundwater pollution also referred to as groundwater contamination is not as easily classified as surface water pollution. by its very nature groundwater aquifers are susceptible to contamination from sources that may not directly affect surface water bodies. the distinction of point vs. non point source may be irrelevant. analysis of groundwater contamination may focus on soil characteristics and site geology hydrogeology hydrology and the nature of the contaminants. causes of groundwater pollution include naturally occurring on site sanitation systems sewage fertilizers and pesticide commercial and industrial leaks hydraulic fracturing landfill leachate. surface water and groundwater have often been studied and managed as separate resources even though they are interrelated. surface water seeps through the soil and becomes groundwater. conversely groundwater can also feed surface water sources. sources of surface water pollution are generally grouped into two categories based on their origin. point source water pollution refers to contaminants that enter a waterway from a single identifiable source such as a pipe or ditch. examples of sources in this category include discharges from a sewage treatment plant a factory or a city storm drain. the u. s. clean water act defines point source for regulatory enforcement purposes. the cwa definition of point source was amended in to include municipal storm sewer systems as well as industrial storm water such as from construction sites. nonpoint source pollution refers to diffuse contamination that does not originate from a single discrete source. this type of pollution is often the cumulative effect of small amounts of contaminants gathered from a large area. a common example is the leaching out of nitrogen compounds from fertilized agricultural lands. nutrient runoff in storm water from sheet flow over an agricultural field or a forest are also cited as examples of non point source pollution. contaminated storm water washed off of parking lots roads and highways called urban runoff is sometimes included under the category of non point sources. this runoff becomes a point source because it is typically channeled into storm drain systems and discharged through pipes to local surface waters. the specific contaminants leading to pollution in water include a wide spectrum of chemicals pathogens and physical changes such as elevated temperature and discoloration. while many of the chemicals and substances that are regulated may be naturally occurring the concentration usually determines what is a natural component of water and what is a contaminant. high concentrations of naturally occurring substances can have negative impacts on aquatic flora and fauna. oxygen depleting substances may be natural materials such as plant matter as well as man made chemicals. other natural and anthropogenic substances may cause turbidity which blocks light and disrupts plant growth and clogs the gills of some fish species. alteration of waters physical chemistry includes acidity electrical conductivity temperature and eutrophication. eutrophication is an increase in the concentration of chemical nutrients in an ecosystem to an extent that increases the primary productivity of the ecosystem. depending on the degree of eutrophication subsequent negative environmental effects such as anoxia and severe reductions in water quality may occur affecting fish and other animal populations. disease causing microorganisms are referred to as pathogens. pathogens can produce waterborne diseases in either human or animal hosts. coliform bacteria which are not an actual cause of disease are commonly used as a bacterial indicator of water pollution. other microorganisms sometimes found in contaminated surface waters that have caused human health problems include high levels of pathogens may result from on site sanitation systems or inadequately treated sewage discharges. older cities with ageing infrastructure may have leaky sewage collection systems which can cause sanitary sewer overflows. some cities also have combined sewers which may discharge untreated sewage during rain storms. silt from sewage discharges also pollutes water bodies. pathogen discharges may also be caused by poorly managed livestock operations. contaminants may include organic and inorganic substances. many of the chemical substances are toxic. organic water pollutants include inorganic water pollutants include macroscopic pollution large visible items polluting the water may be termed floatables in an urban storm water context or marine debris when found on the open seas and can include such items as thermal pollution is the rise or fall in the temperature of a natural body of water caused by human influence. thermal pollution unlike chemical pollution results in a change in the physical properties of water. a common cause of thermal pollution is the use of water as a coolant by power plants and industrial manufacturers. elevated water temperatures decrease oxygen levels which can kill fish and alter food chain composition reduce species biodiversity and foster invasion by new thermophilic species. urban runoff may also elevate temperature in surface waters. thermal pollution can also be caused by the release of very cold water from the base of reservoirs into warmer rivers. water pollution may be analyzed through several broad categories of methods physical chemical and biological. most involve collection of samples followed by specialized analytical tests. some methods may be conducted in situ without sampling such as temperature. government agencies and research organizations have published standardized validated analytical test methods to facilitate the comparability of results from disparate testing events. sampling of water for physical or chemical testing can be done by several methods depending on the accuracy needed and the characteristics of the contaminant. many contamination events are sharply restricted in time most commonly in association with rain events. for this reason grab samples are often inadequate for fully quantifying contaminant levels. scientists gathering this type of data often employ auto sampler devices that pump increments of water at either time or discharge intervals. sampling for biological testing involves collection of plants and animals from the surface water body. depending on the type of assessment the organisms may be identified for biosurveys and returned to the water body or they may be dissected for bioassays to determine toxicity. common physical tests of water include temperature solids concentrations and turbidity. water samples may be examined using the principles of analytical chemistry. many published test methods are available for both organic and inorganic compounds. frequently used methods include ph biochemical oxygen demand chemical oxygen demand nutrients metals oil and grease total petroleum hydrocarbons and pesticides. biological testing involves the use of plant animal or microbial indicators to monitor the health of an aquatic ecosystem. they are any biological species or group of species whose function population or status can reveal what degree of ecosystem or environmental integrity is present. one example of a group of bio indicators are the copepods and other small water crustaceans that are present in many water bodies. such organisms can be monitored for changes that may indicate a problem within their ecosystem. in urban areas of developed countries municipal wastewater is typically treated by centralized sewage treatment plants. well designed and operated systems can remove percent or more of the pollutant load in sewage. some plants have additional systems to remove nutrients and pathogens but these more advanced treatment steps get progressively more expensive. nature based solutions are also being used instead of centralized treatment plants. cities with sanitary sewer overflows or combined sewer overflows employ one or more engineering approaches to reduce discharges of untreated sewage including households or businesses not served by a municipal treatment plant may have an individual septic tank which pre treats the wastewater on site and infiltrates it into the soil. this can lead to groundwater pollution if not properly done. globally about. billion people currently do not have safely managed sanitation according to an estimate by the joint monitoring programme for water supply and sanitation. lack of access to sanitation often leads to water pollution e. g. via the practice of open defecation during rain events or floods the human feces are moved from the ground where they were deposited into surface waters. simple pit latrines may also get flooded during rain events. the use of safely managed sanitation services would prevent this type of water pollution. some industrial facilities generate wastewater that is similar to domestic sewage and can be treated by sewage treatment plants. industries that generate wastewater with high concentrations of organic matter toxic pollutants or nutrients such as ammonia need specialized treatment systems. ch. some industries install a pre treatment system to remove some pollutants and then discharge the partially treated wastewater to the municipal sewer system. ch. industries generating large volumes of wastewater typically operate their own treatment systems. some industries have been successful at redesigning their manufacturing processes to reduce or eliminate pollutants through a process called pollution prevention. to remove heat from wastewater generated by power plants or manufacturing plants the following technologies are used non point source controlssediment washed off fields is the largest source of agricultural pollution in the united states. farmers may utilize erosion controls to reduce runoff flows and retain soil on their fields. common techniques include contour plowing crop mulching crop rotation planting perennial crops and installing riparian buffers. pp. nutrients are typically applied to farmland as commercial fertilizer animal manure or spraying of municipal or industrial wastewater or sludge. nutrients may also enter runoff from crop residues irrigation water wildlife and atmospheric deposition. p. farmers can develop and implement nutrient management plans to reduce excess application of nutrients pp. and reduce the potential for nutrient pollution. to minimize pesticide impacts farmers may use integrated pest management techniques to maintain control over pests reduce reliance on chemical pesticides and protect water quality. point source wastewater treatmentfarms with large livestock and poultry operations such as factory farms are called concentrated animal feeding operations or feedlots in the us and are being subject to increasing government regulation. animal slurries are usually treated by containment in anaerobic lagoons before disposal by spray or trickle application to grassland. constructed wetlands are sometimes used to facilitate treatment of animal wastes. some animal slurries are treated by mixing with straw and composted at high temperature to produce a bacteriologically sterile and friable manure for soil improvement. sediment from construction sites is managed by installation of discharge of toxic chemicals such as motor fuels and concrete washout is prevented by use of effective control of urban runoff involves reducing the velocity and flow of storm water as well as reducing pollutant discharges. local governments use a variety of storm water management techniques to reduce the effects of urban runoff. these techniques called best management practices for water pollution in the u. s. may focus on water quantity control while others focus on improving water quality and some perform both functions. pollution prevention practices include low impact development techniques installation of green roofs and improved chemical handling. runoff mitigation systems include infiltration basins bioretention systems constructed wetlands retention basins and similar devices. thermal pollution from runoff can be controlled by storm water management facilities that absorb the runoff or direct it into groundwater such as bioretention systems and infiltration basins. retention basins tend to be less effective at reducing temperature as the water may be heated by the sun before being discharged to a receiving stream. p. water pollution is a major environmental issue in india. the largest source of water pollution in india is untreatedsewage. other sources of pollution include agricultural runoff and unregulated small scale industry. most rivers lakes and surface water in india are polluted due to industries untreated sewage and solid wastes. a study found that discharge of untreated sewage is the single most important source of pollution of surface and ground water in india. there is a large gap between generation and treatment of domestic waste water in india. the problem is not only that india lacks sufficient treatment capacity but also that the sewage treatment plants that exist do not operate and are not maintained. the majority of the government owned sewage treatment plants remain closed most of the time due to improper design or poor maintenance or lack of reliable electricity supply to operate the plants together with absentee employees and poor management. the waste water generated in these areas normally percolates into the soil or evaporates. the uncollected waste accumulates in the urban areas causing unhygienic conditions and releasing pollutants that leach into surface and groundwater. a world health organization study reported that out of indias towns and cities just have partial sewage treatment facilities and only have full wastewater treatment facilities. downstream the river water polluted by the untreated water is used for drinking bathing and washing. a report claimed indian cities were dumping untreated sewage and partially cremated bodies directly into the ganges river. lack of toilets and sanitation facilities causes open defecation in rural and urban pill areas of india like many developing countries. this is a source of surface water pollution. sewage discharged from cities towns and some villages is the predominant cause of water pollution in india. investment is needed to bridge the gap between sewage india generates and its treatment capacity of sewage per day. major cities of india produce million litres per day of sewage but the urban sewage treatment capacity is only mld. a large number of indian rivers are severely polluted as a result of discharge of domestic sewage. the central pollution control board a ministry of environment forests government of india entity has established a national water quality monitoring network comprising monitoring stations in states and in union territories on various rivers and water bodies across the country. this effort monitors water quality year round. the monitoring network covers rivers lakes tanks ponds creeks canals drains and wells distributed across india. water samples are routinely analysed for parameters including dissolved oxygen bacteriological and other internationally established parameters for water quality. additionally trace metals parameters and pesticide residues are analysed. biomonitoring is also carried out on specific locations. the scientific analysis of water samples from to indicates that the organic and bacterial contamination is severe in water bodies of india. this is mainly due to discharge of domestic waste water in untreated form mostly from the urban centres of india. in the water quality monitoring found almost all rivers with high levels of bod. the worst pollution in decreasing order were found in river markanda followed by river kali river amlakhadi yamuna canal river yamuna at delhi and river betwa. for context a water sample with a day bod between and mg o l indicates a very clean water to mg o l indicates a moderately clean water to indicates borderline water and greater than mg o l indicates ecologically unsafe polluted water. the levels of bod are severe near the cities and major towns. in rural parts of india the river bod levels were sufficient to support aquatic life. rivers yamuna ganga gomti ghaghara river chambal mahi vardha godavari are amongst the other most coliform polluted water bodies in india. for context coliform must be below mpn ml preferably absent from water for it to be considered safe for general human use and for irrigation where coliform may cause disease outbreak from contaminated water in agriculture. in percent of water quality monitoring reported coliform concentrations above mpn ml. during percent of all water quality monitoring stations reported a total coliform levels exceeding those levels suggesting recent effort to add pollution control infrastructure and upgrade treatment plants in india may be reversing the water pollution trend. treatment of domestic sewage and subsequent utilization of treated sewage for irrigation can prevent pollution of water bodies reduce the demand for fresh water in the irrigation sector and become a resource for irrigation. since indian wastewater treatment plant market has been growing annually at the rate of to percent. the united states is the largest supplier of treatment equipment and supplies to india with percent market share of new installation. at this rate of expansion and assuming the government of india continues on its path of reform major investments in sewage treatment plants and electricity infrastructure development india will nearly triple its water treatment capacity by and treatment capacity supply will match indias daily sewage water treatment requirements by about. water conservation in india is gaining pace. the ganga rejuvenation efforts by the union government the yamuna clean up are some of the government initiated efforts. the chennai river restoration trusts efforts to clean the cooum adyar rivers in chennai and civil society efforts spearheaded by organizations like environmentalist foundation of india to clean lakes and ponds in the country are seen as significant development towards water conservation. a joint study by pgimer and punjab pollution control board in revealed that in villages along the nullah fluoride mercury beta endosulphan and heptachlor pesticide were more than permissible limit in ground and tap water. plus the water had high concentration of cod and bod ammonia phosphate chloride chromium arsenic and chlorpyrifos pesticide. the ground water also contains nickel and selenium while the tap water has high concentration of lead nickel and cadmium. flooding during monsoons worsens indias water pollution problem as it washes and moves solid waste and contaminated soils into its rivers and wetlands. the annual average precipitation in india is about billion cubic metres. from this with the state of indian infrastructure in the available water resource through the rivers is about billion cubic meters. accounting to uneven distribution of rain over the country each year water resources available for utilization including ground water is claimed to be about billion cubic meters. much of this water is unsafe because pollution degrades water quality. water pollution severely limits the amount of water available to indian consumers its industry and its agriculture. more than million people live along the ganges river. an estimated persons ritually bathe daily in the river which is considered holy by hindus. ganges river pollution is a major health risk. nrgba was established by the central government of india on february under section of the environment protection act. it also declared ganges as the national river of india. the chair includes the prime minister of india and chief ministers of states through which the ganges flows. by an estimate by delhis sacred yamuna river contained coliform bacteria per cc of water. a lot number of ngos pressure groups eco clubs as well as citizens movements have been active in their task to clean the river. even though india revised its national water policy in to encourage community participation and decentralize water management the countrys complex bureaucracy ensures that it remains a mere statement of intent. responsibility for managing water issues is fragmented among a dozen different ministries and departments without any coordination. the government bureaucracy and state run project department has failed to solve the problem despite having spent many years and million on this project. water pollution in the united states is a growing problem that became critical in the century with the development of mechanized agriculture mining and industry although recent regulation has drastically reduced water pollution throughout the nation. extensive industrialization and rapid urban growth exacerbated water pollution as a lack of regulation allowed for toxic discharges into surface water. in the early century communities began to install drinking water treatment systems but the control of principal pollution sources domestic sewage industry and agriculture was not effectively addressed in the us until the later century. these pollution sources can affect both groundwater or surface water depending on their mode of contamination which could include point nonpoint or transboundary pollution. multiple incidents including water pollution in flint michigan and the deepwater horizon oil spill have left lasting impacts on water quality ecosystems and public health in the united states. multiple solutions to water pollution in the united states can be implemented to curtail water pollution. this includes municipal wastewater treatment agricultural and industrial wastewater treatment erosion and sediment control and the control of urban runoff. the continued successful implementation of water treatment and pollution control measures are used to keep water quality within levels of federal and state regulation. since the passage of thelean water act the levels of water pollution in the united states generally have experienced a dramatic decrease resulting in much cleaner waterways. however more than half of u. s. stream and river miles continue to violate federal water quality standards. surveys of lakes ponds and reservoirs indicated that about percent were impaired and a little more than percent of the nation s coastlines and percent of the surveyed ocean and near coastal areas were also impaired. agriculture industry urban runoff and other sources continue to discharge waste into surface waters nationwide. this poses huge environmental and health risks given that these water sources are used as drinking water and for agricultural use. while the cwa has made positive contributions to the state of surface water in the united states the law does not fully address all aspects of pollution. many think that congress should revise or expand the law to address these problems and gaps in regulation. while the cwa has been effective in controlling point source pollution it has not been effective with nonpoint sources. water pollution can occur in either surface water or groundwater and is classified according to its sources as point non point or transboundary. major causes of water pollution in the united states are municipal sewage spills urban runoff industrial pollution and agricultural pollution. despite the negative health and ecosystem impacts of water pollution solutions exist that are able to treat and decrease pollution levels in water bodies. surface water consists of all forms of visible water sources such as oceans lakes and rivers. currently a significant percentage of surface freshwater sources are polluted in the united states. this poses a huge threat to american water sources because over of water used in the united states is from these freshwater sources. a majority of freshwater contamination cases are a result of nutrient pollution which is the result of farm waste and fertilizer entering the water source and resulting in toxic zones with depleted oxygen levels. groundwater is rainfall that collects in porous spaces deep underground which are called aquifers. humans can access the water that collects in an aquifer by building wells to pump the water to the surface for use. about of drinking water in america comes from groundwater sources. when contaminants enter aquifers the pollution spreads eliminating the potential to use the aquifer for drinking water. groundwater contamination is often the result of chemicals that seep through the soil and into the water supply such as pesticides and fertilizers. other causes of contamination in groundwater includes gasoline oil road salts septic tank waste or leakage from landfills. point source pollution occurs when water pollution contamination comes from a single source. point sources could include leaking septic tanks oil spills dumping waste or wastewater treatment facilities. in order to prevent point source pollution from occurring the clean water act regulates what can be dumped into a specific discharge point by requiring national pollutant discharge elimination system permits. this prevents the discharge of potentially dangerous waste water into us water sources. nonpoint source pollution occurs when the contamination derives from multiple different sources. this type of pollution is very challenging to manage given that the original source can not be identified. nonpoint source pollution is the most common type of pollution because as rainfall runs off of land on its path to different water sources it becomes contaminated by pollutants from the surrounding area. these sources include agriculture related pollutants urban runoff or drainage. trans boundary water pollution occurs when pollution in one country s waters spreads and damages another country s environment or water supply. trans boundary pollution can travel through rivers or ocean currents. municipal sewage is a major contribution to water pollution in the united states. the lack of proper treatment of municipal waste results in the discharge of polluted water into bodies of water across the usa. wastewater continues to pollute water in the united states because there are over miles of sewer pipes across the country many of which are outdated or leaking. poor upkeep of sewer infrastructure results in contamination from leaks and contributed to the american society of civil engineers rating of a d for americas wastewater infrastructure. domestic sewage became a widespread problem with the onset of the industrial revolution in the century population growth and increasing urbanization. through the early century most communities had no sewage treatment plants or waste disposal cites. some cities built sewer pipes which carried the sewage to a nearby river or coastal area but lacked any treatment of the wastes instead depositing sewage directly into the water. the first wastewater treatment plants were built in the late and early centuries in the united states and typically did not fully treat the wastes. while all wastewater is now treated leaks and spills of municipal sewage pose a significant problem because wastewater carries diseases like salmonella hepatitis and many other infectious diseases that roughly sickens about. million americans every year. water research during the late s and s indicated that stormwater runoff was a significant cause of water quality impairment in many parts of the us. increased land development throughout the countryin both cities and suburbshas led to an increase in impervious surfaces which generates increased surface runoff during wet weather. the development of new roads and smooth surfaces have contributed to polluted waters easily flowing into nearby rivers lakes and the oceans across the usa. these paved surfaces and roads restrict water from soaking into the ground and instead allows water to freely flow across pavements while picking up chemicals fertilizers pesticides and many other pollutants that causes water pollution in the bodies of water in the usa. early indications of pollution from industrial waste in the united states existed since the s increasing as the industrial revolution expanded throughout the united states and its environmental impacts were observed more frequently. industrial wastes contribute toxic pollutants and chemicals and can have detrimental ecosystem and public health impacts if discharged directly into surface water. historical accounts of early industrial activity in the us provide a general description of the kinds of waste generated. mining operations iron forges and blast furnaces were some of the early industries in the u. s. that generated waste. in the late and early centuries wastes from mining operations entered rivers and streams and iron bloomeries and furnaces used water for cooling. these industries were relatively small businesses generating small amounts of product and the wastes they discharged to rivers and streams were proportionately dilute. however as factories grew in the century so did the quantity of pollution produced. in the early century the introduction of steam engines in both the mining and manufacturing sectors greatly expanded productivity and increased use of the engines generated larger volumes of heated water. the productivity gains along with the introduction of railroads in the s and swhich increased the overall demand for coal and mineralsled to additional generation of wastes. today industrial pollution is caused by discharges and emissions from manufacturing plants which continues to pollute our bodies of water. common manufacturing methods release wastewater discharge contributing to the water pollution found in rivers lakes and oceans across the states. the u. s. environmental protection agency found that power plants were the largest contributors of industrial water pollution. the epa found instances where power plants dumped pollutants such as mercury arsenic and lead into surface waters. the continuation of chemical dumping by industrial facilities plays a key role in water pollution today in the usa. according to the epa water pollution from industrial facilities is responsible for polluting water quality in more than miles of rivers and more than acres of lakes ponds estuaries nationwide. discharges and chemicals from agriculture greatly contributes to water pollution in the us as rainwater flows through fields and into bodies of water. the application of chemical fertilizers collection of animal manure and use of chemicals used by farmers results in nitrogen and phosphorus. when washed away from farming fields nitrogen and phosphorus found in fertilizers can cause eutrophication of water bodies. eutrophication results in algal blooms which deplete oxygen in bodies of water resulting in dead zones where life can no longer be sustained. excessive use or improper use of fertilizers pesticides and various types of chemicals during farming contribute to water pollution and are currently the third largest source for water pollution in lakes second largest source of water pollution in wetlands and a major contributor to pollution in estuaries and ground water. other activities that contributing to water pollution include municipal wastewater is composed of human waste and other residential waste streams. in the united states approximately billion gallons of wastewater are collected every day and sent to wastewater treatment plants. wastewater is collected through combined sewers which are used for sanitary waste and stormwater runoff or in separate sanitary sewers. wastewater treatment plants include physical removal processes such as screens and settling tanks and biological processes to remove organic matter and pathogens from water. some plants have enhanced treatment processes to target nitrogen removal from influent water. treatment plants have strict permitting on the quality of effluent water to ensure discharged water will not cause harm to the environment or public health. agricultural run off is one of the leading causes of water pollution in the united states. funding from clean water grants are available to farmers to install projects to help control agricultural pollution before it enters water sources. methods to minimize and contain water pollution from agriculture in the united states include watershed efforts nutrient management cover crops buffers management of livestock waste and drainage management. buffers are small strips of land covered in plants that are able to remove pollutants such as nitrogen phosphorus and sediment prior to discharge in a water body. both buffers and crop covers are used to remove these pollutants from agricultural runoff. erosion and sediment controls are techniques used to mitigate sediment pollution in waterways. the most common and efficient control method is crop management which increases soil cover and stabilizes slopes. without proper soil stabilization techniques rainfall can cause large quantities of sediment to be washed away into waterways creating issues with sunlight penetration and visibility. additional pollution control measures include silt fences erosion control matting and shoreline restoration. urban areas affect water quality by increasing the volume of run off and pollutant loads. one solution to decrease run off is constructing new surfaces with pervious pavers that allow rainwater to pass through the surface to groundwater aquifers and decrease the quantity of urban run off. additionally proper use and storage of household chemicals are critical to decrease incidences of spills that pollute local waterways. the water crisis in flint michigan began in after the state switched the city s water supply from lake huron to the flint river to reduce costs. the state of michigan backed the cost saving transition after a audit estimated that flint was over million in debt from mishandling of the city s finances. however the flint river water supply lacked the necessary corrosion control treatment to prevent lead release from pipes and plumbing a traditional material used in pipes. the failure to follow the necessary protocol exposed over residents to lead and other contaminants. soon after the change to the flint river citizens were complaining that their water had become noticeably dirty and foul smelling. the pipe corrosion had led to a significant increase in bacteria levels and exposed residents to harmful concentrations of lead and heavy metals. the flint water supply was linked to a outbreak of legionnaires disease a severe form of pneumonia caused by the bacteria legionella pneumophila. the outbreak following the flint water crisis was one of the most widespread instances of legionnaires disease in u. s. history with confirmed cases and deaths. in addition to the dangerous waterborne bacteria the water also tested for extremely high levels of lead. a study by hurley medical center revealed the proportion of infants and children with above average levels of lead in their blood had essentially doubled since making the switch to the flint river. young children and infants are especially sensitive to lead exposure with physical and behavioral consequences occurring at much lower levels of lead in children than in adults. according to the world health organization lead exposure has detrimental effects on children causing poor brain development lower iq behavioral changes like shortening of attention span and increased antisocial behavior and reduced educational attainment. in addition the effects of lead are thought to be permanent. the environmental pollution in flint began long before the switch in water supply. flint is a city that capitalized on the industrial revolution starting with the lumber mills of the s to automobile factories in the early s. notably general motors has a large scale operation in flint. gm s presence in flint reached it s height in the early s employing more than workers on their factories along the river. gm s success in flint coincided with environmental waste and pollution. the river deteriorated from decades of industrial dumping from gm and it s suppliers eventually becoming so polluted the city had to begin buying water from detroit. five years later the flint water crisis is still very relevant. despite making the switch back to lake huron for the city s water supply costly damage has been done on flint s water infrastructure. until all lead pipes are replaced the issue still exists and the city s goal is to have all corroded service lines replaced by. called the fast start project flint hopes to replace lead service lines by next year a settlement the city agreed to in a lawsuit. the state of michigan supported the initiative with an million commitment in addition to a million contribution from congress and the epa. the deepwater horizon oil spill began on april when a semi submersible bp oil rig exploded in the gulf of mexico about miles off of the coast of louisiana. the explosion lead to the largest marine oil spill in history discharging anywhere from to barrels of oil per day. it took responders days to stop the spill at which point the rig had leaked an estimated. million barrels of oil into the gulf. over miles of shoreline on the gulf of mexico from texas to florida were impacted by the deepwater horizon spill. of the crew members present during the deepwater horizon oil spill died and were seriously injured. in addition the frequency of hurricanes in the gulf makes the effects of long term exposure on humans more applicable as these storms are capable of carrying crude oil over miles of ocean towards the shore. according to a research article from lsu damages to those living in the presence of crude oil the past years are likely permanent as chronic exposure leads to increased cancer risks cardiovascular issues and respiratory problems. oil exposure and it s respiratory effects were also analyzed in a study on the coast guard personnel deployed to help clean up the spill. the article has. of responders stating they were exposed to crude oil and. stating they were exposed to oil dispersants. of the nearly personnel who completed the survey. experienced coughing. experienced shortness of breath and. experienced wheezing. the study also found that exposure to both oil and oil dispersants presented associations that were much stronger than oil alone for the different respiratory symptoms. the northeast gulf of mexico shoreline contains about percent of the coastal and freshwater marshes in the united states. a marsh environment tends to have standing water making it among the most sensitive habitats to oil spills. without the natural cleaning mechanism that flowing water provides oil is able to coat marsh vegetation for longer periods of time ruining nurseries that then impact a host of interconnected species. the gulf of mexico is also home to species of marine mammals. of these up to percent of all kemp s ridley sea turtles present during the spill ended up dying and the louisiana bottlenose dolphin ended up facing a percent decline in population. however because the bp oil spill occurred miles from any land it wasn t as damaging to ecosystems along the shore as other oil spills. however habitats along the shore were still exposed through balls of tar that would clump together and wash up on beaches impacting local wildlife. also the consequences that drifting plumes of oil had on the deep sea ecosystem is relatively unknown. in december the u. s. filed a complaint in district court against bp and several other defendants associated with the spill. the complaint resulted in a record setting settlement enforcing a. billion clean water act penalty on bp exploration production and up to. billion in natural resource damages. however by bp had successfully recuperated most of the billion lost in market value after the spill. this recovery was attributed to the company s inclination to continue exploring new oil resources despite the accident. between and bp s gulf of mexico oil rigs doubled and they began investing billion towards opportunities in alaska in. on the other hand a article from npr exhibited how fishing cities along the gulf coast are still feeling harmful effects of the oil spill. in an interview with an oysterman from alabama he states business is still struggling... because of the lack of oyster production... i place the blame for that on the oil spill. the fisherman goes on to describe how the oyster reefs off of louisiana have not been producing like they should since the spill. water pollution in the city of woburn massachusetts gained public recognition in the lawsuit filed by the families of children in woburn who had died from leukemia in unusually high numbers. the families attributed the leukemia to the town s polluted drinking water which had been contaminated over years of industry most notably the toxic compounds used by leather factories in the area. on august workers on the gold king mine in silverton colorado released million gallons of toxic wastewater when attempting to add a tap to the tailing pond for the mine. the wastewater carried unsafe levels of heavy metals with some parts of the river testing for hundreds of times over their limits. the martin county coal slurry spill occurred on october when a coal slurry broke into an abandoned mine and sent an estimated million gallons of slurry into the tug fork river. the spill polluted miles of the big sandy river and a water supply for over residents. in professor marc edwards discovered lead levels at least times higher than accepted limits while performing research on pipe corrosion for the d. c. water and sewer authority. the lead exposure has left thousands of children with lifelong health risks. on december a dike ruptured on the kingston fossil plant in roane county tennessee and released. billion gallons of coal fly ash slurry into the emory river. it was the largest fly ash release and worst coal ash related disaster in u. s. history. during the late century there was little federal government attention paid to what were considered to be local environmental and health problems. the only federal legislation to address water pollution during this era was the rivers and harbors act of. in the law congress prohibited the dumping of refuse debris that interfered with navigationbut other forms of pollution were not addressed. in to address oil spills in harbors congress passed the oil pollution act. the law provided for penalties in the event of oil spills but they were applicable only to vessels in coastal waters. in the s and s state water boards were created to monitor some aspects of water quality. the clean water act of was the first act of its kind to establish regulation governing water quality and discharge in the united states. the cwa governs procedures for pollution control and water treatment. additionally the act also sets criteria for water pollutants in surface water. this regulation names the environmental protection agency as the authority over pollution in surface waters in the united states allowing them to set further regulation to protect waterways. before this it was legal to discharge wastewater to surface waters without testing for or removing water pollutants. the cwa was amended in and to address municipal water treatment construction and to later establish the clean water state revolving fund which provides grants to states to aid in water treatment processes. under the cwa the national pollution discharge elimination system regulates permits for discharges into bodies of water. this system requires each polluter to apply for a specific permit for their wastewater discharges which led to the need for industrial wastewater treatment processes as discharge water could no longer be released without treatment. the permit also includes monitoring and reporting requirements which allows the epa to assess total pollutant volumes entering a waterway. the cwa and npdes form the backbone of regulation for controlling surface water pollution in the united states. additional regulation exists on a state by state basis allowing for more stringent regulation for protected bodies of water. additional regulation may be enacted to limit pollution that comes from non point sources such as agriculture. pollution is the introduction of contaminants into the natural environment that cause adverse change. pollution can take the form of chemical substances or energy such as noise heat or light. pollutants the components of pollution can be either foreign substances energies or naturally occurring contaminants. pollution is often classed as point source or nonpoint source pollution. in pollution killed million people in the world. major forms of pollution include air pollution light pollution littering noise pollution plastic pollution soil contamination radioactive contamination thermal pollution visual pollution water pollution. air pollution has always accompanied civilizations. pollution started from prehistoric times when man created the first fires. according to a article in the journal science soot found on ceilings of prehistoric caves provides ample evidence of the high levels of pollution that was associated with inadequate ventilation of open fires. metal forging appears to be a key turning point in the creation of significant air pollution levels outside the home. core samples of glaciers in greenland indicate increases in pollution associated with greek roman and chinese metal production. the burning of coal and wood and the presence of many horses in concentrated areas made the cities the primary sources of pollution. the industrial revolution brought an infusion of untreated chemicals and wastes into local streams that served as the water supply. king edward i of england banned the burning of sea coal by proclamation in london in after its smoke became a problem the fuel was so common in england that this earliest of names for it was acquired because it could be carted away from some shores by the wheelbarrow. it was the industrial revolution that gave birth to environmental pollution as we know it today. london also recorded one of the earlier extreme cases of water quality problems with the great stink on the thames of which led to construction of the london sewerage system soon afterward. pollution issues escalated as population growth far exceeded viability of neighborhoods to handle their waste problem. reformers began to demand sewer systems and clean water. in the sanitary conditions in berlin were among the worst in europe. august bebel recalled conditions before a modern sewer system was built in the late s the primitive conditions were intolerable for a world national capital and the imperial german government brought in its scientists engineers and urban planners to not only solve the deficiencies but to forge berlin as the worlds model city. a british expert in concluded that berlin represented the most complete application of science order and method of public life adding it is a marvel of civic administration the most modern and most perfectly organized city that there is. the emergence of great factories and consumption of immense quantities of coal gave rise to unprecedented air pollution and the large volume of industrial chemical discharges added to the growing load of untreated human waste. chicago and cincinnati were the first two american cities to enact laws ensuring cleaner air in. pollution became a major issue in the united states in the early twentieth century as progressive reformers took issue with air pollution caused by coal burning water pollution caused by bad sanitation and street pollution caused by the million horses who worked in american cities in generating large quantities of urine and manure. as historian martin melosi notes the generation that first saw automobiles replacing the horses saw cars as miracles of cleanliness.. by the s however automobile caused smog was a major issue in los angeles. other cities followed around the country until early in the century when the short lived office of air pollution was created under the department of the interior. extreme smog events were experienced by the cities of los angeles and donora pennsylvania in the late s serving as another public reminder. air pollution would continue to be a problem in england especially later during the industrial revolution and extending into the recent past with the great smog of. awareness of atmospheric pollution spread widely after world war ii with fears triggered by reports of radioactive fallout from atomic warfare and testing. then a non nuclear event the great smog of in london killed at least people. this prompted some of the first major modern environmental legislation the clean air act of. pollution began to draw major public attention in the united states between the mid s and early s when congress passed the noise control act the clean air act the clean water act and the national environmental policy act. severe incidents of pollution helped increase consciousness. pcb dumping in the hudson river resulted in a ban by the epa on consumption of its fish in. national news stories in the late s especially the long term dioxin contamination at love canal starting in and uncontrolled dumping in valley of the drums led to the superfund legislation of. the pollution of industrial land gave rise to the name brownfield a term now common in city planning. the development of nuclear science introduced radioactive contamination which can remain lethally radioactive for hundreds of thousands of years. lake karachay named by the worldwatch institute as the most polluted spot on earth served as a disposal site for the soviet union throughout the s and s. chelyabinsk russia is considered the most polluted place on the planet. nuclear weapons continued to be tested in the cold war especially in the earlier stages of their development. the toll on the worst affected populations and the growth since then in understanding about the critical threat to human health posed by radioactivity has also been a prohibitive complication associated with nuclear power. though extreme care is practiced in that industry the potential for disaster suggested by incidents such as those at three mile island chernobyl and fukushima pose a lingering specter of public mistrust. worldwide publicity has been intense on those disasters. widespread support for test ban treaties has ended almost all nuclear testing in the atmosphere. international catastrophes such as the wreck of the amoco cadiz oil tanker off the coast of brittany in and the bhopal disaster in have demonstrated the universality of such events and the scale on which efforts to address them needed to engage. the borderless nature of atmosphere and oceans inevitably resulted in the implication of pollution on a planetary level with the issue of global warming. most recently the term persistent organic pollutant has come to describe a group of chemicals such as pbdes and pfcs among others. though their effects remain somewhat less well understood owing to a lack of experimental data they have been detected in various ecological habitats far removed from industrial activity such as the arctic demonstrating diffusion and bioaccumulation after only a relatively brief period of widespread use. a much more recently discovered problem is the great pacific garbage patch a huge concentration of plastics chemical sludge and other debris which has been collected into a large area of the pacific ocean by the north pacific gyre. this is a less well known pollution problem than the others described above but nonetheless has multiple and serious consequences such as increasing wildlife mortality the spread of invasive species and human ingestion of toxic chemicals. organizations such as gyres have researched the pollution and along with artists like marina debris are working toward publicizing the issue. pollution introduced by light at night is becoming a global problem more severe in urban centres but nonetheless contaminating also large territories far away from towns. growing evidence of local and global pollution and an increasingly informed public over time have given rise to environmentalism and the environmental movement which generally seek to limit human impact on the environment. the major forms of pollution are listed below along with the particular contaminant relevant to each of them a pollutant is a waste material that pollutes air water or soil. three factors determine the severity of a pollutant its chemical nature the concentration and the persistence. pollution has a cost. manufacturing activities that cause air pollution impose health and clean up costs on the whole of society whereas the neighbors of an individual who chooses to fire proof his home may benefit from a reduced risk of a fire spreading to their own homes. a manufacturing activity that causes air pollution is an example of a negative externality in production. a negative externality in production occurs when a firm s production reduces the well being of others who are not compensated by the firm. for example if a laundry firm exists near a polluting steel manufacturing firm there will be increased costs for the laundry firm because of the dirt and smoke produced by the steel manufacturing firm. if external costs exist such as those created by pollution the manufacturer will choose to produce more of the product than would be produced if the manufacturer were required to pay all associated environmental costs. because responsibility or consequence for self directed action lies partly outside the self an element of externalization is involved. if there are external benefits such as in public safety less of the good may be produced than would be the case if the producer were to receive payment for the external benefits to others. however goods and services that involve negative externalities in production such as those that produce pollution tend to be over produced and underpriced since the externality is not being priced into the market. pollution can also create costs for the firms producing the pollution. sometimes firms choose or are forced by regulation to reduce the amount of pollution that they are producing. the associated costs of doing this are called abatement costs or marginal abatement costs if measured by each additional unit. in pollution abatement capital expenditures and operating costs in the us amounted to nearly billion. society derives some indirect utility from pollution otherwise there would be no incentive to pollute. this utility comes from the consumption of goods and services that create pollution. therefore it is important that policymakers attempt to balance these indirect benefits with the costs of pollution in order to achieve an efficient outcome. it is possible to use environmental economics to determine which level of pollution is deemed the social optimum. for economists pollution is an external cost and occurs only when one or more individuals suffer a loss of welfare however there exists a socially optimal level of pollution at which welfare is maximized. this is because consumers derive utility from the good or service manufactured which will outweigh the social cost of pollution until a certain point. at this point the damage of one extra unit of pollution to society the marginal cost of pollution is exactly equal to the marginal benefit of consuming one more unit of the good or service. in markets with pollution or other negative externalities in production the free market equilibrium will not account for the costs of pollution on society. if the social costs of pollution are higher than the private costs incurred by the firm then the true supply curve will be higher. the point at which the social marginal cost and market demand intersect gives the socially optimal level of pollution. at this point the quantity will be lower and the price will be higher in comparison to the free market equilibrium. therefore the free market outcome could be considered a market failure because it does not maximize efficiency. this model can be used as a basis to evaluate different methods of internalizing the externality. some examples include tariffs a carbon tax and cap and trade systems. air pollution comes from both natural and human made sources. however globally human made pollutants from combustion construction mining agriculture and warfare are increasingly significant in the air pollution equation. motor vehicle emissions are one of the leading causes of air pollution. china united states russia india mexico and japan are the world leaders in air pollution emissions. principal stationary pollution sources include chemical plants coal fired power plants oil refineries petrochemical plants nuclear waste disposal activity incinerators large livestock farms pvc factories metals production factories plastics factories and other heavy industry. agricultural air pollution comes from contemporary practices which include clear felling and burning of natural vegetation as well as spraying of pesticides and herbicidesabout million metric tons of hazardous wastes are generated each year. the united states alone produces about million metric tons. americans constitute less than of the worlds population but produce roughly of the worlds co and generate approximately of worlds waste. in china has overtaken the united states as the worlds biggest producer of co while still far behind based on per capita pollution ranked among the worlds nations. in february a report by the intergovernmental panel on climate change representing the work of scientists economists and policymakers from more than countries said that humans have been the primary cause of global warming since. humans have ways to cut greenhouse gas emissions and avoid the consequences of global warming a major climate report concluded. but to change the climate the transition from fossil fuels like coal and oil needs to occur within decades according to the final report this year from the uns intergovernmental panel on climate change. some of the more common soil contaminants are chlorinated hydrocarbons heavy metals mtbe zinc arsenic and benzene. in a series of press reports culminating in a book called fateful harvest unveiled a widespread practice of recycling industrial byproducts into fertilizer resulting in the contamination of the soil with various metals. ordinary municipal landfills are the source of many chemical substances entering the soil environment emanating from the wide variety of refuse accepted especially substances illegally discarded there or from pre landfills that may have been subject to little control in the u. s. or eu. there have also been some unusual releases of polychlorinated dibenzodioxins commonly called dioxins for simplicity such as tcdd. pollution can also be the consequence of a natural disaster. for example hurricanes often involve water contamination from sewage and petrochemical spills from ruptured boats or automobiles. larger scale and environmental damage is not uncommon when coastal oil rigs or refineries are involved. some sources of pollution such as nuclear power plants or oil tankers can produce widespread and potentially hazardous releases when accidents occur. in the case of noise pollution the dominant source class is the motor vehicle producing about ninety percent of all unwanted noise worldwide. adverse air quality can kill many organisms including humans. ozone pollution can cause respiratory disease cardiovascular disease throat inflammation chest pain and congestion. water pollution causes approximately deaths per day mostly due to contamination of drinking water by untreated sewage in developing countries. an estimated million indians have no access to a proper toilet over ten million people in india fell ill with waterborne illnesses in and people died most of them children. nearly million chinese lack access to safe drinking water. a analysis estimated that. million people died prematurely each year in china because of air pollution. the high smog levels china has been facing for a long time can do damage to civilians bodies and generate different diseases the who estimated in that air pollution causes half a million deaths per year in india. studies have estimated that the number of people killed annually in the united states could be over. oil spills can cause skin irritations and rashes. noise pollution induces hearing loss high blood pressure stress and sleep disturbance. mercury has been linked to developmental deficits in children and neurologic symptoms. older people are majorly exposed to diseases induced by air pollution. those with heart or lung disorders are at additional risk. children and infants are also at serious risk. lead and other heavy metals have been shown to cause neurological problems. chemical and radioactive substances can cause cancer and as well as birth defects. an october study by the lancet commission on pollution and health found that global pollution specifically toxic air water soils and workplaces kill nine million people annually which is triple the number of deaths caused by aids tuberculosis and malaria combined and times higher than deaths caused by wars and other forms of human violence. the study concluded that pollution is one of the great existential challenges of the anthropocene era. pollution endangers the stability of the earth s support systems and threatens the continuing survival of human societies. pollution has been found to be present widely in the environment. there are a number of effects of this the toxicology and environmental health information program at the united states national library of medicine maintains a comprehensive toxicology and environmental health web site that includes access to resources produced by tehip and by other government agencies and organizations. this web site includes links to databases bibliographies tutorials and other scientific and consumer oriented resources. tehip also is responsible for the toxicology data network an integrated system of toxicology and environmental health databases that are available free of charge on the web. toxmap is a geographic information system that is part of toxnet. toxmap uses maps of the united states to help users visually explore data from the united states environmental protection agencys toxics release inventory and superfund basic research programs. a paper linked pollution to adverse school outcomes for children. a number of studies show that pollution has an adverse effect on the productivity of both indoor and outdoor workers. to protect the environment from the adverse effects of pollution many nations worldwide have enacted legislation to regulate various types of pollution as well as to mitigate the adverse effects of pollution. pollution control is a term used in environmental management. it means the control of emissions and effluents into air water or soil. without pollution control the waste products from overconsumption heating agriculture mining manufacturing transportation and other human activities whether they accumulate or disperse will degrade the environment. in the hierarchy of controls pollution prevention and waste minimization are more desirable than pollution control. in the field of land development low impact development is a similar technique for the prevention of urban runoff. the earliest precursor of pollution generated by life forms would have been a natural function of their existence. the attendant consequences on viability and population levels fell within the sphere of natural selection. these would have included the demise of a population locally or ultimately species extinction. processes that were untenable would have resulted in a new balance brought about by changes and adaptations. at the extremes for any form of life consideration of pollution is superseded by that of survival. for humankind the factor of technology is a distinguishing and critical consideration both as an enabler and an additional source of byproducts. short of survival human concerns include the range from quality of life to health hazards. since science holds experimental demonstration to be definitive modern treatment of toxicity or environmental harm involves defining a level at which an effect is observable. common examples of fields where practical measurement is crucial include automobile emissions control industrial exposure pels toxicology and medicine. the solution to pollution is dilution is a dictum which summarizes a traditional approach to pollution management whereby sufficiently diluted pollution is not harmful. it is well suited to some other modern locally scoped applications such as laboratory safety procedure and hazardous material release emergency management. but it assumes that the dilutant is in virtually unlimited supply for the application or that resulting dilutions are acceptable in all cases. such simple treatment for environmental pollution on a wider scale might have had greater merit in earlier centuries when physical survival was often the highest imperative human population and densities were lower technologies were simpler and their byproducts more benign. but these are often no longer the case. furthermore advances have enabled measurement of concentrations not possible before. the use of statistical methods in evaluating outcomes has given currency to the principle of probable harm in cases where assessment is warranted but resorting to deterministic models is impractical or infeasible. in addition consideration of the environment beyond direct impact on human beings has gained prominence. yet in the absence of a superseding principle this older approach predominates practices throughout the world. it is the basis by which to gauge concentrations of effluent for legal release exceeding which penalties are assessed or restrictions applied. one such superseding principle is contained in modern hazardous waste laws in developed countries as the process of diluting hazardous waste to make it non hazardous is usually a regulated treatment process. migration from pollution dilution to elimination in many cases can be confronted by challenging economical and technological barriers. carbon dioxide while vital for photosynthesis is sometimes referred to as pollution because raised levels of the gas in the atmosphere are affecting the earths climate. disruption of the environment can also highlight the connection between areas of pollution that would normally be classified separately such as those of water and air. recent studies have investigated the potential for long term rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide to cause slight but critical increases in the acidity of ocean waters and the possible effects of this on marine ecosystems. the pure earth an international non for profit organization dedicated to eliminating life threatening pollution in the developing world issues an annual list of some of the worlds most polluting industries. a report by the institute for agriculture and trade policy and grain says that the meat and dairy industries are poised to surpass the oil industry as the worlds worst polluters. pure earth issues an annual list of some of the worlds worst polluted places. air pollutionsoil contaminationwater pollutionotherplastic pollution is the accumulation of plastic objects and particles in the earths environment that adversely affects wildlife wildlife habitat and humans. plastics that act as pollutants are categorized into micro meso or macro debris based on size. plastics are inexpensive and durable and as a result levels of plastic production by humans are high. however the chemical structure of most plastics renders them resistant to many natural processes of degradation and as a result they are slow to degrade. together these two factors have led to a high prominence of plastic pollution in the environment. plastic pollution can afflict land waterways and oceans. it is estimated that. to. million metric tons of plastic waste enters the ocean from coastal communities each year. living organisms particularly marine animals can be harmed either by mechanical effects such as entanglement in plastic objects problems related to ingestion of plastic waste or through exposure to chemicals within plastics that interfere with their physiology. effects on humans include disruption of various hormonal mechanisms. as of about million tons of plastic is produced worldwide each year. from the s up to an estimated. billion tons of plastic has been produced worldwide of which an estimated has been recycled and another has been incinerated. this large amount of plastic waste enters the environment with studies suggesting that the bodies of of seabirds contain plastic debris. in some areas there have been significant efforts to reduce the prominence of free range plastic pollution through reducing plastic consumption litter cleanup and promoting plastic recycling. some researchers suggest that by there could be more plastic than fish in the oceans by weight. there are three major forms of plastic that contribute to plastic pollution microplastics as well as mega and macro plastics. mega and micro plastics have accumulated in highest densities in the northern hemisphere concentrated around urban centers and water fronts. plastic can be found off the coast of some islands because of currents carrying the debris. both mega and macro plastics are found in packaging footwear and other domestic items that have been washed off of ships or discarded in landfills. fishing related items are more likely to be found around remote islands. these may also be referred to as micro meso and macro debris. plastic debris is categorized as either primary or secondary. primary plastics are in their original form when collected. examples of these would be bottle caps cigarette butts and microbeads. secondary plastics on the other hand account for smaller plastics that have resulted from the degradation of primary plastics. microdebris are plastic pieces between mm and mm in size. plastic debris that starts off as meso or macrodebris can become microdebris through degradation and collisions that break it down into smaller pieces. microdebris is more commonly referred to as nurdles. nurdles are recycled to make new plastic items but they easily end up released into the environment during production because of their small size. they often end up in ocean waters through rivers and streams. microdebris that come from cleaning and cosmetic products are also referred to as scrubbers. because microdebris and scrubbers are so small in size filter feeding organisms often consume them. nurdles enter the ocean by means of spills during transportation or from land based sources. the ocean conservancy reported that china indonesia philippines thailand and vietnam dump more plastic in the sea than all other countries combined. it is estimated that of the plastics in the ocean are nurdles making them one of the most common types of plastic pollution along with plastic bags and food containers. these micro plastics can accumulate in the oceans and allow for the accumulation of persistent bio accumulating toxins such as bisphenol a polystyrene ddt and pcbs which are hydrophobic in nature and can cause adverse health affects. a study by richard thompson from the university of plymouth uk found a great amount of microdebris on the beaches and waters in europe the americas australia africa and antarctica. thompson and his associates found that plastic pellets from both domestic and industrial sources were being broken down into much smaller plastic pieces some having a diameter smaller than human hair. if not ingested this microdebris floats instead of being absorbed into the marine environment. thompson predicts there may be plastic items km of sea surface and plastic particles km of seabed. international pellet watch collected samples of polythene pellets from beaches from countries which were then analysed for organic micro pollutants. it was found that pellets found on beaches in america vietnam and southern africa contained compounds from pesticides suggesting a high use of pesticides in the areas. plastic debris is categorized as macrodebris when it is larger than mm. these include items such as plastic grocery bags. macrodebris are often found in ocean waters and can have a serious impact on the native organisms. fishing nets have been prime pollutants. even after they have been abandoned they continue to trap marine organisms and other plastic debris. eventually these abandoned nets become too difficult to remove from the water because they become too heavy having grown in weight up to tons. plastics themselves contribute to approximately of discarded waste. many kinds of plastics exist depending on their precursors and the method for their polymerization. depending on their chemical composition plastics and resins have varying properties related to contaminant absorption and adsorption. polymer degradation takes much longer as a result of saline environments and the cooling effect of the sea. these factors contribute to the persistence of plastic debris in certain environments. recent studies have shown that plastics in the ocean decompose faster than was once thought due to exposure to sun rain and other environmental conditions resulting in the release of toxic chemicals such as bisphenol a. however due to the increased volume of plastics in the ocean decomposition has slowed down. the marine conservancy has predicted the decomposition rates of several plastic products. it is estimated that a foam plastic cup will take years a plastic beverage holder will take years a disposable nappy will take years and fishing line will take years to degrade. it was estimated that global production of plastics is approximately mt yr. their abundance has been found to transport persistent organic pollutants also known as pops. these pollutants have been linked to an increased distribution of algae associated with red tides. in the group break free from plastic organized over volunteers in countries to collect and identify plastic waste. these volunteers collected over plastic bags sachets and plastic bottles as reported by the guardian. nearly half of the items were identifiable by consumer brands. the most common brands were coca cola nestl and pepsico. the distribution of plastic debris is highly variable as a result of certain factors such as wind and ocean currents coastline geography urban areas and trade routes. human population in certain areas also plays a large role in this. plastics are more likely to be found in enclosed regions such as the caribbean. it serves as a means of distribution of organisms to remote coasts that are not their native environments. this could potentially increase the variability and dispersal of organisms in specific areas that are less biologically diverse. plastics can also be used as vectors for chemical contaminants such as persistent organic pollutants and heavy metals. in a new report plastic and climate was published. according to the report in plastic will contribute greenhouse gases in the equivalent of million tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. in current trend annual emissions will grow to. billion tons by. by plastic could emit billion tons of greenhouse gas emissions as much as percent of the earths remaining carbon budget. by it will emit billion tons more than half of the carbon budget. those are emission from production transportation incineration but there are also effects on phytoplanktonplastic pollution on land poses a threat to the plants and animals including humans who are based on the land. estimates of the amount of plastic concentration on land are between four and twenty three times that of the ocean. the amount of plastic poised on the land is greater and more concentrated than that in the water. mismanaged plastic waste ranges from percent in east asia and pacific to one percent in north america. the percentage of mismanaged plastic waste reaching the ocean annually and thus becoming plastic marine debris is between one third and one half the total mismanaged waste for that year. chlorinated plastic can release harmful chemicals into the surrounding soil which can then seep into groundwater or other surrounding water sources and also the ecosystem of the world. this can cause serious harm to the species that drink the water. a study found that of tap water samples taken around the world contained plastic pollutants. this was the first study to focus on global drinking water pollution with plastics and showed that with a contamination rate of tap water in the united states was the most polluted followed by lebanon and india. european countries such as the united kingdom germany and france had the lowest contamination rate though still as high as. this means that people may be ingesting between and microparticles of plastic from tap water per year. the analysis found particles of more than. microns in size which is times bigger than a nanometer. it is currently unclear if this contamination is affecting human health but if the water is also found to contain nano particle pollutants there could be adverse impacts on human well being according to scientists associated with the study. however plastic tap water pollution remains under studied as are the links of how pollution transfers between humans air water and soil. in it was estimated that there was approximately million tons of plastic pollution in the worlds oceans. the ocean conservancy reported that china indonesia philippines thailand and vietnam dump more plastic in the sea than all other countries combined. one study estimated that there are more than trillion plastic pieces afloat at sea. the litter that is being delivered into the oceans is toxic to marine life and humans. the toxins that are components of plastic include diethylhexyl phthalate which is a toxic carcinogen as well as lead cadmium and mercury. plankton fish and ultimately the human race through the food chain ingest these highly toxic carcinogens and chemicals. consuming the fish that contain these toxins can cause an increase in cancer immune disorders and birth defects. the majority of the litter near and in the ocean is made up of plastics and is a persistent pervasive source of marine pollution. according to dr. marcus eriksen of the gyres institute there are. trillion particles of plastic pollution that weigh as much as tons. this plastic is taken by the ocean currents and accumulates in large vortexes known as ocean gyres. the majority of the gyres become pollution dumps filled with plastic. in october when research revealed most ocean plastic pollution comes from chinese cargo ships an ocean cleanup spokesperson said everyone talks about saving the oceans by stopping using plastic bags straws and single use packaging. thats important but when we head out on the ocean thats not necessarily what we find. almost of plastic debris that pollutes ocean water which translates to. million tons comes from ocean based sources. marpol an international treaty imposes a complete ban on the at sea disposal of plastics. merchant ships expel cargo sewage used medical equipment and other types of waste that contain plastic into the ocean. in the united states the marine plastic pollution research and control act of prohibits discharge of plastics in the sea including from naval vessels. naval and research vessels eject waste and military equipment that are deemed unnecessary. pleasure crafts release fishing gear and other types of waste either accidentally or through negligent handling. the largest ocean based source of plastic pollution is discarded fishing gear estimated to be up to of plastic debris in some areas. continental plastic litter enters the ocean largely through storm water runoff flowing into watercourses or directly discharged into coastal waters. plastic in the ocean has been shown to follow ocean currents which eventually form into what is known as great garbage patches. knowledge of the routes that plastic follows in ocean currents comes from accidental container drops from ship carriers. for example in may the hansa carrier sailing from korea to the united states broke apart due to a storm ultimately resulting in thousands of dumped shoes these eventually started showing up on the u. s western coast and hawaii. estimates for the contribution of land based plastic vary widely. while one study estimated that a little over of plastic debris in ocean water comes from land based sources responsible for. million tonnes every year. in jambeck et al. calculated that million tonnes of plastic waste was generated in coastal countries in with. to. million tonnes entering the ocean a percentage of only up to. in a study published by science jambeck et al estimated that the largest emitters of oceanic plastic pollution worldwide are from the most to the least china indonesia philippines vietnam sri lanka thailand egypt malaysia nigeria and bangladesh. in a study published by environmental science technology schmidt et al calculated that the yangtze indus yellow river hai river nile ganges pearl river amur niger and the mekong transport of the global load into the sea. a source that has caused concern is landfills. most waste in the form of plastic in landfills are single use items such as packaging. discarding plastics this way leads to accumulation. although disposing of plastic waste in landfills has less of a gas emission risk than disposal through incineration the former has space limitations. another concern is that the liners acting as protective layers between the landfill and environment can break thus leaking toxins and contaminating the nearby soil and water. landfills located near oceans often contribute to ocean debris because content is easily swept up and transported to the sea by wind or small waterways like rivers and streams. marine debris can also result from sewage water that has not been efficiently treated which is eventually transported to the ocean through rivers. plastic items that have been improperly discarded can also be carried to oceans through storm waters. in the pacific gyre specifically n n latitude large bodies with floating marine debris can be found. models of wind patterns and ocean currents indicate that the plastic waste in the northern pacific is particularly dense where the subtropical convergence zone n n latitude meets a southwest northeast line found north of the hawaiian archipelago. in the pacific there are two mass buildups the western garbage patch and the eastern garbage patch the former off the coast of japan and the latter between hawaii and california. the two garbage patches are both part of the great pacific garbage patch and are connected through a section of plastic debris off the northern coast of the hawaiian islands. it is approximated that these garbage patches contain million tons of debris. the waste is not compact and although most of it is near the surface of the pacific it can be found up to more than feet deep in the water. research published in april reported the highest density of plastic rubbish anywhere in the world on remote and uninhabited henderson island in south pacific as a result of the south pacific gyre. the beaches contain an estimated. million items of debris together weighing. tonnes. in a study transect on north beach each day to new items washed up on a metre section. the study noted that purple hermit crabs make their homes in plastic containers washed up on beaches. plastic pollution has the potential to poison animals which can then adversely affect human food supplies. plastic pollution has been described as being highly detrimental to large marine mammals described in the book introduction to marine biology as posing the single greatest threat to them. some marine species such as sea turtles have been found to contain large proportions of plastics in their stomach. when this occurs the animal typically starves because the plastic blocks the animals digestive tract. sometimes marine mammals are entangled in plastic products such as nets which can harm or kill them. entanglement in plastic debris has been responsible for the deaths of many marine organisms such as fish seals turtles and birds. these animals get caught in the debris and end up suffocating or drowning. because they are unable to untangle themselves they also die from starvation or from their inability to escape predators. being entangled also often results in severe lacerations and ulcers. in a report known as plastic debris in the worlds oceans it was estimated that at least different animal species have suffered from entanglement and ingestion of plastic debris. it has been estimated that over marine mammals perish annually due to plastic pollution in oceans. marine organisms get caught in discarded fishing equipment such as ghost nets. ropes and nets used to fish are often made of synthetic materials such as nylon making fishing equipment more durable and buoyant. these organisms can also get caught in circular plastic packaging materials and if the animal continues to grow in size the plastic can cut into their flesh. equipment such as nets can also drag along the seabed causing damage to coral reefs. sea turtles are affected by plastic pollution. some species are consumers of jelly fish but often mistake plastic bags for their natural prey. this plastic debris can kill the sea turtle by obstructing the oesophagus. baby sea turtles are particularly vulnerable according to a study by australian scientists. so too are whales. large amounts of plastics have been found in the stomachs of beached whales. plastic debris started appearing in the stomach of the sperm whale since the s and has been noted to be the cause of death of several whales. in june more than plastic bags were found inside a dying pilot whale that washed up on the shores of thailand. in march a dead cuviers beaked whale washed up in the philippines with lbs of plastic in its stomach. in april following the discovery of a dead sperm whale off of sardinia with pounds of plastic in its stomach the world wildlife foundation warned that plastic pollution is one of the most dangerous threats to sea life noting that five whales have been killed by plastic over a two year period. some of the tiniest bits of plastic are being consumed by small fish in a part of the pelagic zone in the ocean called the mesopelagic zone which is to metres below the ocean surface and completely dark. not much is known about these fish other than that there are many of them. they hide in the darkness of the ocean avoiding predators and then swimming to the oceans surface at night to feed. plastics found in the stomachs of these fish were collected during malaspinas circumnavigation a research project that studies the impact of global change on the oceans. a study conducted by scripps institution of oceanography showed that the average plastic content in the stomachs of mesopelagic fish over different species was.. their estimate for the ingestion rate of plastic debris by these fish in the north pacific was between and tons per year. the most popular mesopelagic fish is the lantern fish. it resides in the central ocean gyres a large system of rotating ocean currents. since lantern fish serve as a primary food source for the fish that consumers purchase including tuna and swordfish the plastics they ingest become part of the food chain. the lantern fish is one of the main bait fish in the ocean and it eats large amounts of plastic fragments which in turn will not make them nutritious enough for other fish to consume. another study found bits of plastic outnumber baby fish by seven to one in nursery waters off hawaii. after dissecting hundreds of larval fish the researchers discovered that many fish species ingested plastic particles. plastics were also found in flying fish which are eaten by top predators such as tunas and most hawaiian seabirds. deep sea animals have been found with plastics in their stomachs. plastic pollution does not only affect animals that live solely in oceans. seabirds are also greatly affected. in it was estimated that gulls in the north sea had an average of thirty pieces of plastic in their stomachs. seabirds often mistake trash floating on the oceans surface as prey. their food sources often has already ingested plastic debris thus transferring the plastic from prey to predator. ingested trash can obstruct and physically damage a birds digestive system reducing its digestive ability and can lead to malnutrition starvation and death. toxic chemicals called polychlorinated biphenyls also become concentrated on the surface of plastics at sea and are released after seabirds eat them. these chemicals can accumulate in body tissues and have serious lethal effects on a birds reproductive ability immune system and hormone balance. floating plastic debris can produce ulcers infections and lead to death. marine plastic pollution can even reach birds that have never been at the sea. parents may accidentally feed their nestlings plastic mistaking it for food. seabird chicks are the most vulnerable to plastic ingestion since they cant vomit up their food like the adult seabirds. after the initial observation that many of the beaches in new zealand had high concentrations of plastic pellets further studies found that different species of prion ingest the plastic debris. hungry prions mistook these pellets for food and these particles were found intact within the birds gizzards and proventriculi. pecking marks similar to those made by northern fulmars in cuttlebones have been found in plastic debris such as styrofoam on the beaches on the dutch coast showing that this species of bird also mistake plastic debris for food. an estimate of. million laysan albatrosses which inhabit midway atoll all have plastics in their digestive system. midway atoll is halfway between asia and north america and north of the hawaiian archipelago. in this remote location the plastic blockage has proven deadly to these birds. these seabirds choose red pink brown and blue plastic pieces because of similarities to their natural food sources. as a result of plastic ingestion the digestive tract can be blocked resulting in starvation. the windpipe can also be blocked which results in suffocation. the debris can also accumulate in the animals gut and give them a false sense of fullness which would also result in starvation. on the shore thousands of birds corpses can be seen with plastic remaining where the stomach once was. the durability of the plastics is visible among the remains. in some instances the plastic piles are still present while the birds corpse has decayed. similar to humans animals exposed to plasticizers can experience developmental defects. specifically sheep have been found to have lower birth weights when prenatally exposed to bisphenol a. exposure to bpa can shorten the distance between the eyes of a tadpole. it can also stall development in frogs and can result in a decrease in body length. in different species of fish exposure can stall egg hatching and result in a decrease in body weight tail length and body length. compounds that are used in manufacturing pollute the environment by releasing chemicals into the air and water. some compounds that are used in plastics such as phthalates bisphenol a polybrominated diphenyl ether are under close statute and might be very hurtful. even though these compounds are unsafe they have been used in the manufacturing of food packaging medical devices flooring materials bottles perfumes cosmetics and much more. the large dosage of these compounds are hazardous to humans destroying the endocrine system. bra imitates the females hormone called estrogen. pbd destroys and causes damage to thyroid hormones which are vital hormone glands that play a major role in the metabolism growth and development of the human body. although the level of exposure to these chemicals varies depending on age and geography most humans experience simultaneous exposure to many of these chemicals. average levels of daily exposure are below the levels deemed to be unsafe but more research needs to be done on the effects of low dose exposure on humans. a lot is unknown on how severely humans are physically affected by these chemicals. some of the chemicals used in plastic production can cause dermatitis upon contact with human skin. in many plastics these toxic chemicals are only used in trace amounts but significant testing is often required to ensure that the toxic elements are contained within the plastic by inert material or polymer. children and women during their reproduction age are at most at risk and more prone to damaging their immune as well as their reproductive system from these hormone disrupting chemicals. it can also affect humans because it may create an eyesore that interferes with enjoyment of the natural environment. due to the pervasiveness of plastic products most of the human population is constantly exposed to the chemical components of plastics. of adults in the united states have had detectable levels of bpa in their urine. exposure to chemicals such as bpa have been correlated with disruptions in fertility reproduction sexual maturation and other health effects. specific phthalates have also resulted in similar biological effects. bisphenol a affects gene expression related to the thyroid hormone axis which affects biological functions such as metabolism and development. bpa can decrease thyroid hormone receptor activity by increasing tr transcriptional corepressor activity. this then decreases the level of thyroid hormone binding proteins that bind to triiodothyronine. by affecting the thyroid hormone axis bpa exposure can lead to hypothyroidism. bpa can disrupt normal physiological levels of sex hormones. it does this by binding to globulins that normally bind to sex hormones such as androgens and estrogens leading to the disruption of the balance between the two. bpa can also affect the metabolism or the catabolism of sex hormones. it often acts as an antiandrogen or as an estrogen which can cause disruptions in gonadal development and sperm production. efforts to reduce the use of plastics and to promote plastic recycling have occurred. some supermarkets charge their customers for plastic bags and in some places more efficient reusable or biodegradable materials are being used in place of plastics. some communities and businesses have put a ban on some commonly used plastic items such as bottled water and plastic bags. in january a global alliance to end plastic waste was created. the alliance aims to clean the environment from existing waste and increase recycling but it does not mention reduction in plastic production as one of its targets. the use of biodegradable plastics has many advantages and disadvantages. biodegradables are biopolymers that degrade in industrial composters. biodegradables do not degrade as efficiently in domestic composters and during this slower process methane gas may be emitted. there are also other types of degradable materials that are not considered to be biopolymers because they are oil based similar to other conventional plastics. these plastics are made to be more degradable through the use of different additives which help them degrade when exposed to uv rays or other physical stressors. yet biodegradation promoting additives for polymers have been shown not to significantly increase biodegradation. although biodegradable and degradable plastics have helped reduce plastic pollution there are some drawbacks. one issue concerning both types of plastics is that they do not break down very efficiently in natural environments. there degradable plastics that are oil based may break down into smaller fractions at which point they do not degrade further. a parliamentary committee in the united kingdom also found that compostable and biodegradable plastics could add to marine pollution because there is a lack of infrastructure to deal with these new types of plastic as well as a lack of understanding about them on the part of consumers. for example these plastics need to be sent to industrial composting facilities to degrade properly but no adequate system exists to make sure waste reaches these facilities. the committee thus recommended to reduce the amount of plastic used rather than introducing new types of it to the market. up to of used plastic medical equipment is incinerated rather than deposited in a landfill as a precautionary measure to lessen the transmission of disease. this has allowed for a large decrease in the amount of plastic waste that stems from medical equipment. if plastic waste is not incinerated and disposed of properly a harmful amount of toxins can be released and dispersed as a gas through air or as ash through air and waterways. many studies have been done concerning the gaseous emissions that result from the incineration process. agencies such as the us environmental protection agency and us food and drug administration often do not assess the safety of new chemicals until after a negative side effect is shown. once they suspect a chemical may be toxic it is studied to determine the human reference dose which is determined to be the lowest observable adverse effect level. during these studies a high dose is tested to see if it causes any adverse health effects and if it does not lower doses are considered to be safe as well. this does not take into account the fact that with some chemicals found in plastics such as bpa lower doses can have a discernible effect. even with this often complex evaluation process policies have been put into place in order to help alleviate plastic pollution and its effects. government regulations have been implemented that ban some chemicals from being used in specific plastic products. in canada the united states and the european union bpa has been banned from being incorporated in the production of baby bottles and childrens cups due to health concerns and the higher vulnerability of younger children to the effects of bpa. taxes have been established in order to discourage specific ways of managing plastic waste. the landfill tax for example creates an incentive to choose to recycle plastics rather than contain them in landfills by making the latter more expensive. there has also been a standardization of the types of plastics that can be considered compostable. the european norm en which was set by the european committee for standardization lists the standards that plastics must meet in terms of compostability and biodegradability in order to officially be labeled as compostable. the canadian federal government formed a current institution that protects marine areas this includes the mitigation of plastic pollution. in canada adopted legislation for oceans management and passed the oceans act. federal governance regional governance and aboriginal peoples are the actors involved in the process of decision making and implementation of the decision. the regional governance bodies are federal provincial and territorial government agencies that hold responsibilities of the marine environment. aboriginal peoples in canada have treaty and non treaty rights related to ocean activities. according to the canadian government they respect these rights and work with aboriginal groups in oceans management activities. with the oceans act made legal canada made a commitment to conserve and protect the oceans. the ocean acts underlying principle is sustainable development precautionary and integrated management approach to ensure that there is a comprehensive understanding in protecting marine areas. in the integrated management approach the oceans act designates federal responsibility to the minister of fisheries and oceans canada for any new and emerging ocean related activities. the act encourages collaboration and coordination within the government that unifies interested parties. moreover the oceans act engages any canadians who are interested in being informed of the decision making regarding ocean environment. in federal organizations developed the federal marine protected areas strategy. this strategy is a collaborative approach implemented by fisheries and oceans canada parks canada and environment canada to plan and manage federal marine protected areas. the federal marine protected areas work with aboriginal groups industries academia environmental groups and ngos to strengthen marine protected areas. the federal marine protected areas network consists of three core programs marine protected areas marine wildlife areas and national marine conservation areas. the mpa is a program to be noted because it is significant in protecting ecosystems from the effects of industrial activities. the mpa guiding principles are integrated management ecosystem based management approach adaptive management approach precautionary principle and flexible management approach. all five guiding principles are used collectively and simultaneously to collaborate and respect legislative mandates of individual departments to use scientific knowledge and traditional ecological knowledge to manage human activities to monitor and report on programs to meet conservation objectives of mpas to use best available information in the absence of scientific certainty and to maintain a balance between conservation needs and sustainable development objectives. the two common forms of waste collection include curbside collection and the use of drop off recycling centers. about percent of the population in the united states have access to curbside and drop off recycling centers. in curbside collection which is available to about percent of the united states population people place designated plastics in a special bin to be picked up by a public or private hauling company. most curbside programs collect more than one type of plastic resin usually both pete and hdpe. at drop off recycling centers which are available to percent of the united states population people take their recyclables to a centrally located facility. once collected the plastics are delivered to a materials recovery facility or handler for sorting into single resin streams to increase product value. the sorted plastics are then baled to reduce shipping costs to reclaimers. there are varying rates of recycling per type of plastic and in the overall plastic recycling rate was approximately in the united states. approximately. million tons of plastics were recycled in the u. s. in. some plastics are recycled more than others in percent of hdpe bottles and percent of pet bottles and jars were recycled. in may a new model to collect packaging from consumers and reuse it will begin. it is called loop. consumers will drop the package in special shipping totes and then a pick up will take it. partners include procter gamble nestl pepsico unilever mars petcare the clorox company the body shop coca cola mondelz danone and other firms. in may the loop service began to function. it has begun with several thousand households but there are on the waitlist. the target is not only stop single use plastic but to stop single use generally. but even durable plastic is not used in contact with foodthe ministry of drinking water and sanitation government of india has requested various governmental departments to avoid the use of plastic bottles to provide drinking water during governmental meetings etc. and to instead make arrangements for providing drinking water that do not generate plastic waste. the state of sikkim has restricted the usage of plastic water bottles and styrofoam products. the state of bihar has banned the usage of plastic water bottles in governmental meetings. the national games of india organised in thiruvananthapuram was associated with green protocols. this was initiated by suchitwa mission that aimed for zero waste venues. to make the event disposable free there was ban on the usage of disposable water bottles. the event witnessed the usage of reusable tableware and stainless steel tumblers. athletes were provided with refillable steel flasks. it is estimated that these green practices stopped the generation of metric tonnes of disposable waste. the city of bangalore in banned the plastic for all purpose other than for few special cases like milk delivery etc. the state of maharashtra india effected the maharashtra plastic and thermocol products ban june subjecting plastic users to fines and potential imprisonment for repeat offenders. in july albania became the first country in europe to ban lightweight plastic bags. albanias environment minister blendi klosi said that businesses importing producing or trading plastic bags less than microns in thickness risk facing fines between million to. million lek. in january the iceland supermarket chain which specializes in frozen foods pledged to eliminate or drastically reduce all plastic packaging for its store brand products by. in bali a pair of two sisters melati and isabel wijsen have gone through efforts to ban plastic bags in. their organization bye bye plastic bags has spread to locations around the world. in the new york banned single use plastic bags and introduced a cent fee for using single use paper bags. the ban will enter into force in. this will not only reduce plastic bag usage in new york state but also eliminate million barrels of oil used to make plastic bags used by the state each year. in the house of representatives of nigeria banned the production import and usage of plastic bags in the country. in israel cities eilat and herzliya decided to ban the usage of single use plastic bags and cutlery on the beaches. the government of india decided to ban single use plastics and take a number of measures to recycle and reuse plastic from october the state of maine ban styrofoam containers in may in the earth day network partnered with keep america beautiful and national cleanup day for the inaugural nationwide earth day cleanup. cleanups were held in all states five us territories sites and had more than volunteers. earth day is the anniversary of earth day. celebrations will include activities such as the great global cleanup citizen science advocacy education and art. this earth day aims to educate and mobilize more than one billion people to grow and support the next generation of environmental activists with a major focus on plastic wasteevery year june is observed as world environment day to raise awareness and increase government action on the pressing issue. in india was host to the world environment day and the theme was beat plastic pollution with a focus on single use or disposable plastic. the ministry of environment forest and climate change of india invited people to take care of their social responsibility and urged them to take up green good deeds in everyday life. several states presented plans to ban plastic or drastically reduce thei use. on april in order to create awareness artist maria cristina finucci founded the garbage patch state at unesco headquarters in paris france in front of director general irina bokova. this was the first of a series of events under the patronage of unesco and of the italian ministry of the environment. soil contamination or soil pollution as part of land degradation is caused by the presence of xenobiotics chemicals or other alteration in the natural soil environment. it is typically caused by industrial activity agricultural chemicals or improper disposal of waste. the most common chemicals involved are petroleum hydrocarbons polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons pyrene solvents pesticides lead and other heavy metals. contamination is correlated with the degree of industrialization and intensity of chemical substance. the concern over soil contamination stems primarily from health risks from direct contact with the contaminated soil vapours from the contaminants or from secondary contamination of water supplies within and underlying the soil. mapping of contaminated soil sites and the resulting cleanups are time consuming and expensive tasks requiring extensive amounts of geology hydrology chemistry computer modeling skills and gis in environmental contamination as well as an appreciation of the history of industrial chemistry. in north america and western europe the extent of contaminated land is best known with many of countries in these areas having a legal framework to identify and deal with this environmental problem. developing countries tend to be less tightly regulated despite some of them having undergone significant industrialization. soil pollution can be caused by the following the most common chemicals involved are petroleum hydrocarbons solvents pesticides lead and other heavy metals. any activity that leads to other forms of soil degradation may indirectly worsen the contamination effects in that soil remediation becomes more tedious. historical deposition of coal ash used for residential commercial and industrial heating as well as for industrial processes such as ore smelting were a common source of contamination in areas that were industrialized before about. coal naturally concentrates lead and zinc during its formation as well as other heavy metals to a lesser degree. when the coal is burned most of these metals become concentrated in the ash. coal ash and slag may contain sufficient lead to qualify as a characteristic hazardous waste defined in the us as containing more than mg l of extractable lead using the tclp procedure. in addition to lead coal ash typically contains variable but significant concentrations of polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons anthracene benzofluoranthene benzofluoranthene benzopyrene indenopyrene phenanthrene anthracene and others. these pahs are known human carcinogens and the acceptable concentrations of them in soil are typically around mg kg. coal ash and slag can be recognised by the presence of off white grains in soil gray heterogeneous soil or bubbly vesicular pebble sized grains. treated sewage sludge known in the industry as biosolids has become controversial as a fertilizer. as it is the byproduct of sewage treatment it generally contains more contaminants such as organisms pesticides and heavy metals than other soil. in the european union the urban waste water treatment directive allows sewage sludge to be sprayed onto land. the volume is expected to double to tons of dry solids in. this has good agricultural properties due to the high nitrogen and phosphate content. in wet weight was sprayed onto. of the land however this is expected to rise fold by. advocates say there is a need to control this so that pathogenic microorganisms do not get into water courses and to ensure that there is no accumulation of heavy metals in the top soil. a pesticide is a substance used to kill a pest. a pesticide may be a chemical substance biological agent antimicrobial disinfectant or device used against any pest. pests include insects plant pathogens weeds mollusks birds mammals fish nematodes and microbes that compete with humans for food destroy property spread or are a vector for disease or cause a nuisance. although there are benefits to the use of pesticides there are also drawbacks such as potential toxicity to humans and other organisms. herbicides are used to kill weeds especially on pavements and railways. they are similar to auxins and most are biodegradable by soil bacteria. however one group derived from trinitrotoluene have the impurity dioxin which is very toxic and causes fatality even in low concentrations. another herbicide is paraquat. it is highly toxic but it rapidly degrades in soil due to the action of bacteria and does not kill soil fauna. insecticides are used to rid farms of pests which damage crops. the insects damage not only standing crops but also stored ones and in the tropics it is reckoned that one third of the total production is lost during food storage. as with fungicides the first insecticides used in the nineteenth century were inorganic e. g. paris green and other compounds of arsenic. nicotine has also been used since the late eighteenth century. there are now two main groups of synthetic insecticides. organochlorines include ddt aldrin dieldrin and bhc. they are cheap to produce potent and persistent. ddt was used on a massive scale from the s with a peak of tonnes used. then usage fell as the harmful environmental effects were realized. it was found worldwide in fish and birds and was even discovered in the snow in the antarctic. it is only slightly soluble in water but is very soluble in the bloodstream. it affects the nervous and endocrine systems and causes the eggshells of birds to lack calcium causing them to be easily breakable. it is thought to be responsible for the decline of the numbers of birds of prey like ospreys and peregrine falcons in the s they are now recovering. as well as increased concentration via the food chain it is known to enter via permeable membranes so fish get it through their gills. as it has low water solubility it tends to stay at the water surface so organisms that live there are most affected. ddt found in fish that formed part of the human food chain caused concern but the levels found in the liver kidney and brain tissues was less than ppm and in fat was ppm which was below the level likely to cause harm. however ddt was banned in the uk and the united states to stop the further buildup of it in the food chain. u. s. manufacturers continued to sell ddt to developing countries who could not afford the expensive replacement chemicals and who did not have such stringent regulations governing the use of pesticides... organophosphates e. g. parathion methyl parathion and about other insecticides are available nationally. parathion is highly toxic methyl parathion is less so and malathion is generally considered safe as it has low toxicity and is rapidly broken down in the mammalian liver. this group works by preventing normal nerve transmission as cholinesterase is prevented from breaking down the transmitter substance acetylcholine resulting in uncontrolled muscle movements. the disposal of munitions and a lack of care in manufacture of munitions caused by the urgency of production can contaminate soil for extended periods. there is little published evidence on this type of contamination largely because of restrictions placed by governments of many countries on the publication of material related to war effort. however mustard gas stored during world war ii has contaminated some sites for up to years and the testing of anthrax as a potential biological weapon contaminated the whole island of gruinard. contaminated or polluted soil directly affects human health through direct contact with soil or via inhalation of soil contaminants which have vaporized potentially greater threats are posed by the infiltration of soil contamination into groundwater aquifers used for human consumption sometimes in areas apparently far removed from any apparent source of above ground contamination. this tends to result in the development of pollution related diseases. health consequences from exposure to soil contamination vary greatly depending on pollutant type pathway of attack and vulnerability of the exposed population. chronic exposure to chromium lead and other metals petroleum solvents and many pesticide and herbicide formulations can be carcinogenic can cause congenital disorders or can cause other chronic health conditions. industrial or man made concentrations of naturally occurring substances such as nitrate and ammonia associated with livestock manure from agricultural operations have also been identified as health hazards in soil and groundwater. chronic exposure to benzene at sufficient concentrations is known to be associated with higher incidence of leukemia. mercury and cyclodienes are known to induce higher incidences of kidney damage and some irreversible diseases. pcbs and cyclodienes are linked to liver toxicity. organophosphates and carbonates can induce a chain of responses leading to neuromuscular blockage. many chlorinated solvents induce liver changes kidney changes and depression of the central nervous system. there is an entire spectrum of further health effects such as headache nausea fatigue eye irritation and skin rash for the above cited and other chemicals. at sufficient dosages a large number of soil contaminants can cause death by exposure via direct contact inhalation or ingestion of contaminants in groundwater contaminated through soil. the scottish government has commissioned the institute of occupational medicine to undertake a review of methods to assess risk to human health from contaminated land. the overall aim of the project is to work up guidance that should be useful to scottish local authorities in assessing whether sites represent a significant possibility of significant harm to human health. it is envisaged that the output of the project will be a short document providing high level guidance on health risk assessment with reference to existing published guidance and methodologies that have been identified as being particularly relevant and helpful. the project will examine how policy guidelines have been developed for determining the acceptability of risks to human health and propose an approach for assessing what constitutes unacceptable risk in line with the criteria for sposh as defined in the legislation and the scottish statutory guidance. not unexpectedly soil contaminants can have significant deleterious consequences for ecosystems. there are radical soil chemistry changes which can arise from the presence of many hazardous chemicals even at low concentration of the contaminant species. these changes can manifest in the alteration of metabolism of endemic microorganisms and arthropods resident in a given soil environment. the result can be virtual eradication of some of the primary food chain which in turn could have major consequences for predator or consumer species. even if the chemical effect on lower life forms is small the lower pyramid levels of the food chain may ingest alien chemicals which normally become more concentrated for each consuming rung of the food chain. many of these effects are now well known such as the concentration of persistent ddt materials for avian consumers leading to weakening of egg shells increased chick mortality and potential extinction of species. effects occur to agricultural lands which have certain types of soil contamination. contaminants typically alter plant metabolism often causing a reduction in crop yields. this has a secondary effect upon soil conservation since the languishing crops can not shield the earths soil from erosion. some of these chemical contaminants have long half lives and in other cases derivative chemicals are formed from decay of primary soil contaminants. cleanup or environmental remediation is analyzed by environmental scientists who utilize field measurement of soil chemicals and also apply computer models for analyzing transport and fate of soil chemicals. various technologies have been developed for remediation of oil contaminated soil and sediments there are several principal strategies for remediation various national standards for concentrations of particular contaminants include the united states epa region preliminary remediation goals the u. s. epa region risk based concentrations and national environment protection council of australia guideline on investigation levels in soil and groundwater. the immense and sustained growth of the peoples republic of china since the s has exacted a price from the land in increased soil pollution. the state environmental protection administration believes it to be a threat to the environment to food safety and to sustainable agriculture. according to a scientific sampling million mu of chinas cultivated land have been polluted with contaminated water being used to irrigate a further. million mu and another million mu covered or destroyed by solid waste. in total the area accounts for one tenth of chinas cultivatable land and is mostly in economically developed areas. an estimated million tonnes of grain are contaminated by heavy metals every year causing direct losses of billion yuan. according to the received data from member states in the european union the number of estimated potential contaminated sites is more than. million and the identified contaminated sites around thousand. municipal and industrial wastes contribute most to soil contamination followed by the industrial commercial sector. mineral oil and heavy metals are the main contaminants contributing around to soil contamination. in terms of budget the management of contaminated sites is estimated to cost around billion euros annually. generic guidance commonly used in the united kingdom are the soil guideline values published by the department for environment food and rural affairs and the environment agency. these are screening values that demonstrate the minimal acceptable level of a substance. above this there can be no assurances in terms of significant risk of harm to human health. these have been derived using the contaminated land exposure assessment model. certain input parameters such as health criteria values age and land use are fed into clea uk to obtain a probabilistic output. guidance by the inter departmental committee for the redevelopment of contaminated land has been formally withdrawn by defra for use as a prescriptive document to determine the potential need for remediation or further assessment. the clea model published by defra and the environment agency in march sets a framework for the appropriate assessment of risks to human health from contaminated land as required by part iia of the environmental protection act. as part of this framework generic soil guideline values have currently been derived for ten contaminants to be used as intervention values. these values should not be considered as remedial targets but values above which further detailed assessment should be considered see dutch standards. three sets of clea sgvs have been produced for three different land uses namely it is intended that the sgvs replace the former icrcl values. the clea sgvs relate to assessing chronic risks to human health and do not apply to the protection of ground workers during construction or other potential receptors such as groundwater buildings plants or other ecosystems. the clea sgvs are not directly applicable to a site completely covered in hardstanding as there is no direct exposure route to contaminated soils. to date the first ten of fifty five contaminant sgvs have been published for the following arsenic cadmium chromium lead inorganic mercury nickel selenium ethyl benzene phenol and toluene. draft sgvs for benzene naphthalene and xylene have been produced but their publication is on hold. toxicological data has been published for each of these contaminants as well as for benzopyrene benzene dioxins furans and dioxin like pcbs naphthalene vinyl chloride tetrachloroethane and tetrachloroethane trichloroethane tetrachloroethene carbon tetrachloride dichloroethane trichloroethene and xylene. the sgvs for ethyl benzene phenol and toluene are dependent on the soil organic matter content content. as an initial screen the sgvs for som are considered to be appropriate. in march the issue of uranium poisoning in punjab attracted press coverage. it was alleged to be caused by fly ash ponds of thermal power stations which reportedly lead to severe birth defects in children in the faridkot and bhatinda districts of punjab. the news reports claimed the uranium levels were more than times the maximum safe limit. in the government of india confirmed that the ground water in malwa belt of punjab has uranium metal that is above the trace limits set by the united nations world health organization. scientific studies based on over samples from various sampling points could not trace the source to fly ash and any sources from thermal power plants or industry as originally alleged. the study also revealed that the uranium concentration in ground water of malwa district is not times the who limits but only above the who limit in locations. this highest concentration found in samples was less than those found naturally in ground waters currently used for human purposes elsewhere such as finland. research is underway to identify natural or other sources for the uranium. look at any ecosystem and there could be multiple forms of contaminationstreams full of toxic chemicals from industrial processes rivers overloaded with nutrients from farms trash blowing away from landfills city skies covered in smog. even landscapes that appear pristine can experience the effects of pollution sources located hundreds or thousands of miles away. pollution may muddy landscapes poison soils and waterways or kill plants and animals. humans are also regularly harmed by pollution. long term exposure to air pollution for example can lead to chronic respiratory disease lung cancer and other diseases. toxic chemicals that accumulate in top predators can make some species unsafe to eat. more than one billion people lack access to clean water and. billion don t have adequate sanitation putting them at risk of contracting deadly diseases. plastic has only been mass produced since the s but it s having a devastating impact on sea turtles. many of us are doing our part to reduce plastic pollution by recycling and reducing single use items but governments must also step up to take accountability and end this pollution epidemic. toxic waste barrels in nepalmany of the activities and products that make modern human life possible are polluting the world. even places that are relatively untouched by century developments experience the effects of pollution. by the world s chemical production had increased fold since. chemicals have made much of modern life possible but they ve also contaminated landscapes around the world. they can travel great distances by air or accumulate in the bodies of animals and humans who absorb chemicals through the skin or ingest them in food or water. while some chemicals may be harmless others can cause damage. increasingly there is particular concern lately about three types of chemicals chemicals that persist in the environment and accumulate in the bodies of wildlife and people endocrine disruptors that can interfere with hormones and chemicals that cause cancer or damage dna. litter in the world s oceans comes from many sources including containers that fall off ships during storms trash that washes off city streets into rivers that lead into the sea and waste from landfills that blows into streams or directly into the ocean. once in the ocean this debris may degrade slowly and persist for years traveling the currents accumulating in large patches and washing up on beaches. use of pesticides and fertilizers on farms has increased by fold over the past years fueling increases in crop production globally. but there have been serious environmental consequences. indiscriminate pesticide and fertilizer application may pollute nearby land and water and chemicals may wash into nearby streams waterways and groundwater when it rains. pesticides can kill non target organisms including beneficial insects soil bacteria and fish. fertilizers are not directly toxic but their presence can alter the nutrient system in freshwater and marine areas. this alteration can result in an explosive growth of algae due to excess nutrients. as a result the water is depleted of dissolved oxygen and fish and other aquatic life may be killedair pollution brings to mind visions of smokestacks billowing black clouds into the sky but this pollution comes in many forms. the burning of fossil fuels in both energy plants and vehicles releases massive amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere causing climate change. industrial processes also emit particulate matter such as sulfur dioxide carbon monoxide and other noxious gases. indoor areas can become polluted by emissions from smoking and cooking. some of these chemicals when released into the air contribute to smog and acid rain. short term exposure to air pollution can irritate the eyes nose and throat and cause upper respiratory infections headaches nausea and allergic reactions. long term exposures can lead to chronic respiratory disease lung cancer and heart disease. long term exposures also can lead to significant climatic changes that can have far reaching negative impacts on food water and ecosystems. artificial light and noise often drown out natural landscapes. in the arctic the sounds of oil and gas explorations are so loud that belugas bowhead whales and other sea life have had difficulty feeding and breeding. light pollution disrupts circadian rhythms for both humans and animals alike and may even contribute to the development of cancer. light pollution also can impact sea turtles. adult and hatchling sea turtles are drawn toward lights along the beach thinking they are heading toward the moon. coastal developments therefore are encouraged to turn off their lights or cover them at nighta littered coastline in the philippineshuman activities contaminate ecosystems around the worldfrom pole to pole from the highest mountains to the ocean deep. toxic chemicals can be found in pristine forests and the blood of arctic animals. litter floats beneath the surface of oceans miles away from land. even excess noise and light are interrupting natural patterns and disrupting the lives of animals and people. when toxic chemicals and metals enter the environment organisms may absorb them through their skin or ingest them in their food or water. animals higher in the food chain accumulate these toxins in higher and higher concentrations a process called biomagnification. top predatorsincluding fish birds and mammalscan have much higher levels of these toxins in their bodies making them more likely to experience the diseases birth defects genetic mutations and other deleterious effects of these poisons. clean freshwater is an essential ingredient for a healthy human life but. billion people lack access to water and. billion don t have adequate sanitation. water becomes polluted from toxic substances dumped or washed into streams and waterways and the discharge of sewage and industrial waste. these pollutants come in many formsorganic inorganic even radioactiveand can make life difficult if not impossible for humans animals and other organisms alike. human activities especially agriculture have led to large increases in the levels of nitrogen and phosphorus in the environment. in water this overabundance of nutrients a process called eutrophication can fuel the excessive growth of phytoplankton and algae which can sometimes have devastating consequences. harmful algal bloomsblooms of species that produce deadly toxins and sometimes known as red tides or brown tides for their appearance in the watercan kill fish marine mammals and seabirds and harm humans. and when the algae and other organisms that had been allowed to bloom because of the nutrient excess eventually die off bacteria may suck up all the oxygen from the water as the algae decompose. this hypoxia creates a dead zone where fish can not live. more than areas around the world have been identified as experiencing eutrophication and are hypoxic. when water in the atmosphere mixes with certain chemicalsparticularly sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides emitted during the burning of fossil fuelsmild acidic compounds are formed. this acid rain can leach toxic aluminum from the soil which at low levels can stress fish in lakes and streams or at higher concentrations kill them outright. acid rain also weakens trees in forests and contributes to air pollution that can harm humans. plastics and other marine debris that can float may persist in the oceans for years traveling the currents. some of this material accumulates in the centers of ocean gyres creating great garbage patches. the term garbage patch brings to mind floating islands of trash but little of the debris can be seen on the surface. garbage patches instead are areas where concentrations of flotsam and jetsam mostly small pieces of plastic are particularly high. this litter can distribute toxic chemicals throughout the oceans snag and tear corals and harm animals if they ingest pieces of plastic or become entangled in the debris. wwf monitors contamination and

eruptions wind erosion pollen dispersal evaporation of organic compounds and natural radioactivity. pollution from natural occurrences is not very often. human activities that result in air pollution include. emissions from industries and manufacturing activitiesconsider a typical manufacturing plant you will notice that there are long tubes erected high into the air with lots of smoke and fumes coming out of it. waste incinerators manufacturing industries and power plants emit high levels of carbon monoxide organic compounds and chemicals into the air. this happens almost everywhere that people live. petroleum refineries also release lots of hydrocarbons into the air.. burning fossil fuels after the industrial age transportation has become a key part of our lives. cars and heavy duty trucks trains shipping vessels and airplanes all burn lots of fossil fuels to work. emissions from automobile engines contain both primary and secondary pollutants. this is a major cause of pollution and one that is very difficult to manage. this is because humans rely heavily on vehicles and engines for transporting people good and services. fumes from car exhausts contain dangerous gases such as carbon monoxide oxides of nitrogen hydrocarbons and particulates. on their own they cause great harm to people who breathe them. additionally they react with environmental gases to create further toxic gases. click here to see the effects. household and farming chemicals crop dusting fumigating homes household cleaning products or painting supplies over the counter insect pest killers fertilizer dust emits harmful chemicals into the air and cause pollution. in many cases when we use these chemicals at home or offices with no or little ventilation we may fall ill if we breathe them. introduction to climate changemany people make climate change and global warming a scary and difficult thing to understand but it s not. scientists have warned that the worlds climate has changed a lot and has affected many living and non living things. many places that were warmer are now getting colder and many colder regions are getting much colder or even warmer. for example between and it is believed that the earths temperature has risen by. c. rainfall amounts have also risen in the mid latitudes of the northern hemisphere since the beginning of the century. it is also believed that sea levels have risen up to about cm globally with lots of glaciers melting in addition. some people do not believe that these are caused by human activities. they think it is all political and falsehood intended to cause panic among humans. well whatever it is we would like to know more and take a few good points from this confusion and use them to make our world a better place to live. tip... climate change refers to general changes in climate patterns including temperature precipitation winds and other factors. global warming refers specifically to any change in the global average surface temperature. do not confuse the two. climate change is a change of the composition of global atmosphere observed over a period of time and in comparison to other time periods as a direct or indirect result of human activity. let s start by learning a few tricky terms that we may need to explain climate change better. see other lessons available on eschooltodaydroughts earthquakes

water water scarcity waste and recyclingwhat is noise pollution what is water pollution water pollution is the contamination of water bodies very often by human activities. water pollution occur when pollutants are discharged directly or indirectly into water bodies without enough treatment to get rid of harmful compounds. pollutants get into water mainly by human causes or human factors. water pollution can be a point source non point source or transboundary in nature. water pollution is the second most imperative environmental concern along with air pollution. any change or modification in the physical chemical and biological properties of water that will have a detrimental consequence on living things is water pollution. the water pollution problem water covers over of the earth s surface. it is a very important resource for people and the environment. water is obviously crucial to human health. the who advises that at least. litres per day per person are necessary to meet the requirements of most people under most conditions and at least another litres per day to cover basic hygienic needs.. unep isbn number page as long as humans live water will be needed and consumed. this means humans are bound to create wastewater. it also means we will produce other non water items and the disposal of waste from that process will affect fresh water ad the environment in some way. water pollution affects drinking water rivers lakes and oceans all over the world. in many developing countries it is usually a leading cause of death by people drinking from polluted water sources. function popup cutelittlewindow window. open more to this water pollution affects not only individual living species but also populations and entire functioning ecosystems that exist in the waters. humans have now realised the importance of clean water as a foundation for life. in recent time more and more organisations and councils are working hard to educate protect restore waterways and encourage practices that help keep waters from contamination and also to preserve water ecosystems from destruction. note check out transboundary point source and non point source pollution here. see more related lessons hereaquacultureclimate change ecosystemsearth systemfood waste forest preservation genetic engineering landforms natural resources ocean acidification overfishing ozone depletion pollination renewable energywaste water water scarcity waste and recycling types of water pollution there are many types of water pollution because water comes from many sources. here are a few types of water pollution. nutrients pollution some wastewater fertilizers and sewage contain high levels of nutrients. if they end up in water bodies they encourage algae and weed growth in the water. this will make the water undrinkable and even clog filters. too much algae will also use up all the oxygen in the water and other water organisms in the water will die out of oxygen starvation.. surface water pollution surface water includes natural water found on the earths surface like rivers lakes lagoons and oceans. hazardous substances coming into contact with this surface water dissolving or mixing physically with the water can be called surface water pollution.. oxygen depleting water bodies have micro organisms. these include aerobic and anaerobic organisms. when too much biodegradable matter end up in water it encourages more microorganism growth and they use up more oxygen in the water. if oxygen is depleted aerobic organisms die and anaerobic organisms grow more to produce harmful toxins such as ammonia and sulfides.. ground water pollution when humans apply pesticides and chemicals to soils they are washed deep into the ground by rainwater. this gets to underground water causing pollution underground. this means when we dig wells and bore holes to get water from underground it needs to be checked for ground water pollution.. microbiological in many communities in the world people drink untreated water. sometimes there is natural pollution caused by microorganisms like viruses bacteria and protozoa. this natural pollution can cause fishes and other water life to die. they can also cause serious illness to humans who drink from such waters.. suspended matter some pollutants do not easily dissolve in water. this kind of material is called particulate matter. some suspended pollutants later settle under the water body. this can harm and even kill aquatic organisms that live at the bottom of water bodies.. chemical water pollution many industries and farmers work with chemicals that end up in water. this is common with point source pollution. these include chemicals that are used to control weeds insects and pests. metals and solvents from industries can pollute water bodies. these are poisonous to many forms of aquatic life and may slow their development make them infertile and kill them.. oil spillage oil spills usually have only a localized effect on wildlife but can spread for miles. the oil can cause the death to many fish and get stuck to the feathers of seabirds causing them to lose their ability to fly. do you remember the bp oil spill in over animals were reported dead including many already on the endangered species list. of the animals affected by the spill only about have been reported cleaned but many biologists and other scientists predict they will die too from the stress caused by the pollution. see other lessons available on eschooltoday droughts earthquakes flooding hurricanes landslides

causes of water pollution. industrial waste industries cause huge water pollution with their activities. these come mainly from sulphur this is a non metallic substance that is harmful to marine life. asbestos this pollutant has cancer causing properties. when inhaled it can cause illnesses such as asbestosis and some types of cancer. lead and mercury these are metallic elements and can cause environmental and health problems for humans and animals. it is also poisonous. it is usually very hard to clean it up from the environment once it gets into it because it is non biodegradable. nitrates phosphates these are found in fertilizers and are often washed from the soils to nearby water bodies. they can cause eutrophication which can be very problematic to marine environments. oils oils form a thick layer on the water surface because they do not dissolve in water. this can stop marine plants receiving enough light for photosynthesis. it is also harmful to fish and marine birds. a classic example is the bp oil spill in with killed thousands of animal species. read more on this hereoil pollution by oil industriesroutine shipping run offs and dumping of oils on the ocean surfaces happen every day. oil spills make up about of the oil that enters the ocean. oil spills cause major problems and can be extremely harmful to local marine wildlife such as fish birds and sea otters and other aquatic life. because oil does not dissolve it stays on the water surface and suffocates fish. oil also gets caught in the feathers of seabirds making it difficult for them to fly. some animals die as a result. the next page shows more causes of water pollution. see more related lessons hereaquacultureclimate changefood wastegenetic engineering landformsocean acidification

the previous page here are some more sewage and waste water every day we cook do laundry flush the toilet wash our cars shower and do many things that use water. think about how we use water in schools hospitals and public places. where do you think all the water liquid waste poop and urine end up in many developed communities wastewater and soluble waste is treated cleaned and dumped into the sea or river. even though they are treated they are never the same as fresh water. function popup cutelittlewindow window. open in some not so developed countries the sewage is not treated but quickly dumped into the sea or water bodies. this is very dangerous because they contaminate the environment and water bodies and bring many deadly diseases to us. septic tanks every domestic toilet is connected to septic tank usually located outside the house. each time poop is flushed down the toilet it goes into this tank where the solid part is separated from the liquid part. biological processes are used to break down the solids and the liquid is usually drained out into a land drainage system. from this stage it can escape into the soil and nearby water bodies. ocean and marine dumping again think of the rubbish we all make each day. paper waste food waste plastic rubber metallic and aluminum waste. in some countries they are deposited into the sea. these waste types take some time to decompose. for example it is known that paper takes about weeks aluminum takes about years and glass takes even more years. when these end up in the sea they harm sea animals and cause a lot of water animal deaths. underground storage and tube leakages many liquid products are stored in metal and steel tubes underground. other sewage systems run in underground tubes. over time they rust and begin to leak. if that happens they contaminate the soils and the liquids in them end up in many nearby water bodies. atmospheric atmospheric deposition is the pollution of water bodies caused by air pollution. each time the air is polluted with sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide they mix with water particles in the air and form a toxic substance. this falls as acid rain to the ground and gets washed into water bodies. the result is that water bodies also get contaminated and this affects animals and water organisms. see more related lessons hereaquacultureclimate

recycling effects of water pollution. you will notice in the previous pages that water pollution is very harmful to humans animals and water life. the effects can be catastrophic depending on the kind of chemicals concentrations of the pollutants and where there are polluted. below we shall see a summary of the effects of water pollution. the effects of water pollution are varied and depend on what chemicals are dumped and in which locations. many water bodies near urban areas are highly polluted. this is the result of both garbage dumped by individuals and dangerous chemicals legally or illegally dumped by manufacturing industries health centers schools and market places. death of aquatic animals the main problem caused by water pollution is that it kills organisms that depend on these water bodies. dead fish crabs birds and sea gulls dolphins and many other animals often wind up on beaches killed by pollutants in their habitat. disruption of food chains pollution disrupts the natural food chain as well. pollutants such as lead and cadmium are eaten by tiny animals. later these animals are consumed by fish and shellfish and the food chain continues to be disrupted at all higher levels. diseases eventually humans are affected by this process as well. people can get diseases such as hepatitis by eating seafood that has been poisoned. in many poor nations there is always outbreak of cholera and diseases as a result of poor drinking water treatment from contaminated waters. did you read about the water contamination in flint michigan usa read here. destruction of ecosystemsecosystems can be severely changed or destroyed by water pollution. many areas are now being affected by careless human pollution and this pollution is coming back to hurt humans in many

the deterioration of the earth s land surfaces often directly or indirectly as a result of man s activities and their misuse of land resources. it occurs when waste is not disposed of properly or can occur when humans throw chemicals onto the soil in the form of pesticides insecticides and fertilizers during agricultural practices. exploitation of minerals has also contributed to the destruction of the earth s surface. since the industrial revolution natural habitats have been destroyed and environments have been polluted causing diseases in both humans and many other species of animals. it is important to understand that land pollution is not just littering although it is a part of the issue. land pollution is a way bigger issue. it is more of an industrial issue involving big oil refineries industries that manufacture chemicals herbicides pesticides and fertilizers used in farming. it also involves illegal dumping of waste in landfills and so on. human actions have also caused many large areas of land to lose or reduce their capacity to support life forms and ecosystems. this is known as land degradation. note that land degradation can result from many factors and land pollution is only one of them. in the lesson we shall see the more about land and environmental pollution the sources of the pollution its consequences and a few things we can do to prevent further pollution and protect our environment. see other lessons available on eschooltodaydroughts earthquakes flooding hurricanes landslides tornadoes volcanoes wild fires windsasexual reproduction clouds

types of land pollution. many publications group them differently. let us see these four main types solid wastethese include all the various kinds of rubbish we make at home school hospitals market and workplaces. things like paper plastic containers bottles cans food and even used cars and broken electronic goods broken furniture and hospital waste are all examples of solid waste. some of these are biodegradable. examples include food droppings paper products as well as vegetation. others are not biodegradable and they include plastics metals and aluminum cans broken computer and car parts. because these do not easily decay they pile up in landfills where they stay for thousands of years. these bring great harm to the land and people around it. see the complete lesson on waste here. pesticides and fertilizers many farming activities engage in the application of fertilizers pesticides and insecticides for higher crop yield. this is good because we get more food but can you think of what happens to the chemicals that end up on the crops and soils sometimes insects and small animals are killed and bigger animals that eat tiny animals are also harmed. finally the chemicals may be washed down as it rains and over time they end up in the water table below. chemicals chemical and nuclear power plants produce waste materials that have to be stored somewhere. fertilizer insecticides pesticides pharmaceuticals manufacturers also produce lots of solid and liquid waste. in many cases they are stored in an environmentally safe way but there are some that find their way into landfills and other less safe storage facilities. sometimes they also find their way into leaking pipes and gutters. they end up polluting soils and making crops harmful to our health. deforestation humans depend on trees for many things including life. trees absorb carbon dioxide from the air and enrich the air with oxygen which is needed for life. trees provide wood for humans and a habitat to many land animals insects and birds. trees also help replenish soils and help retain nutrients being washed away. unfortunately we have cut down millions of acres of trees for wood construction farming and mining purposes and never planted new trees back. this is a type of land pollution. sources of land pollution. below are some sources of solid and semi solid pollutants agricultural sources these include waste matter produced by crop animal manure and farm residues. they also include the chemical left over of all pesticides fertilisers and insecticides used for agricultural activities. ashes the residual matter that remains after solid fuels are burned. when waste is burned in incinerators two types of ashes are produced. bottom ash is the debris from burnt metal and glass waste. bottom ash is not bio degradable. the second type of ash is called fly ash. this is the ash that is trapped by filters in the chimney of the incinerators. it is known to be very toxic. every four trucks of waste burnt produce about one truck of ashes that end up in the landfill too. ashes easily leak into the soil and water tables causing land and water pollution. mining sources this includes piles of coal refuse and heaps of slag and underground debris. mining and forestry activities that clear the land surfaces and use skid trails often leave the land unrestored. the surface is exposed to erosion which destroys the quality of the land. additionally iron and other chemicals such as copper mercury and lead from mining practices leach into the soil polluting it and leaving it exposed to water bodies as well. industrial sources these include paints chemicals metals and aluminum plastics and so on that are produces in the process of manufacturing goods. sewage treatment wastes that are left over after sewage has been treated biomass sludge and settled solids. some of these are sent directly to landfills whiles other treatment plants burn them to generate electricity. both end up polluting the environment. garbage or waste these include household or municipal waste such as glass metal cloth plastic wood paper and so on. some of these can decay and others can not. they are usually collected and sent to landfills where the pollution action begins. construction sources these include waste like debris wood metals and plastics that are produced from construction activities. deforestation this is when trees are cut down for economic purposes mining farming and construction. in forests areas trees absorb and reflect about of the intense heat from the sun protecting and preserving its surface soils. cutting down trees mean that the land is exposed to direct sunlight and rain resulting in soil erosions desertification and land degradationchemical and nuclear plants these include chemical waste from chemical industries that are disposed of into landfills. oil refineries when crude oil is refined into usable petrol gas or diesel there are by products that end up as waste. see more related lessons hereaquacultureclimate change ecosystemsearth systemfood waste forest preservation genetic engineering landforms ocean acidification overfishing ozone depletion pollinationrenewable energywaste water water scarcity waste and recycling effects of land pollutionecosystems it is disturbing to think that the wonderful benefits of a healthy ecosystem are threatened by land and soil pollution. hazardous chemicals in the soil can potentially wipe out living organisms in the soil. these organisms help to break down organic matter in the soil and help aerate the soil. a polluted land or soil will therefore not be able to support the plants and animals that depend on it in keeping food chains intact. water sources anytime it rains water washes the surfaces of these polluted lands and runs off to nearby water sources. all the dangerous chemicals and harmful litter such as plastics glass and metal pieces are washed into water bodies. these make the waters unsafe for consumption and also harmful to animals that live in the water. in addition to this. chemicals in the soil are leached further down into the water table thereby polluting them in the process. vegetation vegetation plays a vital role in climate control food water purification shelter and so on. the activity of mining industry landfills and the like are destructive to vegetation and threaten the benefits that vegetation provides. health there are many pollutants in soils that can be very harmful when exposed to humans over long periods. for example pollutants in soils such as arsenic found in pesticides mining of gold lead and copper are toxic when exposed to humans. long exposures to humans may cause arsenic poisoning. they can also cause skin heart liver some kinds of cancers and neurological damage. environments landfills littered communities and places with dirty landscapes are generally not attractive to tourists and visitors. this means such communities usually miss out on the value and benefits of tourism and investment. in some cities there are very bad smells lots of rats mice and insects that spread diseases. these animals thrive in dirty places. governments spend a lot of money cleaning up and managing trash and the polluted landscape. that money could have been used for other important things such as healthcare and education. many landfills are always burning and they cause further air pollution. more on land pollution effects heresource. page table who ten chemicals of major public health concern

is the difference soil pollution is when humans introduce harmful objects chemicals or substances directly or indirectly into the soil in a way that causes harm to other living things or destroys soil or water ecosystems. soil pollution is often considered as a hidden danger because it is a kind of pollution that is not easily visible to the eye although its effects can be catastrophic. soil contamination is when the concentration of chemicals nutrients or elements in the soil becomes more than it normally or naturally is as a result of human action. if this contamination goes on to harm living organisms we can call it pollution. soil degradation is when the soil loses its value as a result of over farming over grazing or erosion. for example if a bush fire wipes out the vegetation on a piece of land thereby exposing the soils and nutrients in the soil get dissolved by rainwater run off the ability of the soil to support plant life is reduced. we can call this soil degradation. what causes contamination pesticides and herbicides often end up contamination soils. direct discharge of wastewater by industries can also cause that. leakages in sewage systems underground storage tanks and leaching of soluble substances from landfills can also result in contamination. rainwater or floods from other polluted lands and water bodies spread contaminants to soils in other locations. the effects of soils contamination soil contamination can result in soil and land pollution and affect the health of plants that depend on them. it can also harm living organisms in the soils and humans that come into contact with them by touching breathing or eating crops from contaminated soils. contaminants in soils can also get infiltrated into ground water and pollute them. depending on the extent and volume of soil contamination it can be remedied by. digging out the soils for treatment and disposal. containing it to prevent it from spreading by placing large plastic materials over the affected area.. treating the soils with some safe chemicals to neutralize the contaminant. how to prevent land pollutionlike many other challenges the best way to solve problems is to understand it. this means learning about it is the greatest step forward. as we now know the larger issues of land and soils pollution are causeby bigger mining and industrial operations. as young individuals it can be hard to think that you can actually do anything to improve the situation... but you can. get involved with the discussion and be a part of the solution. get your parents friends and neighbors to know more about the issue. if you can vote be sure that your leaders are thinking about it too and vote for the right people. here are a few other tips on how you can help reduce land pollution people should be educated and made aware of the harmful effects of littering. discuss with friends and family and talk about it. reuse any items that you can. items like clothing bottles wrapping paper and shopping bags can be used over and over again rather than buying new things. the greatest prevention to land pollution is in the three rs reduce waste reuse things and recycle things. this is true even for governments. they can also use the three r rule to minimize the amount of waste that ends up in landfills. after the three rs remember to turn the rest of the garbage into compost. personal litter should be disposed properly. we can separate household waste at home for recycling. more than half of our household waste could be recycled or re used but once it is mixed up it becomes more difficult to separate different components for recycling. this is also true for the waste we make at school or hospitals. buy biodegradable products. store all liquid chemicals and waste in spill proof containers. eat organic foods that are grown without pesticides. look out for fertilizer or pesticide free products when you go to the market. don t use pesticides if you can. use a drip tray to collect engine oil. buy products that have little packaging. don t dump motor oil on the ground. governments can also ensure that there are incentives for people to recycle and re use things. related lessons aquacultureclimate change ecosystemsearth systemfood waste forest preservation genetic engineering landforms ocean acidification overfishing ozone depletion

is the bright orange pink glow that hangs over cities and towns in the night. sky glow could be caused by natural factors but also often caused by inefficient and artificial lights shinning needlessly into the sky and further scattered by airborne dust particles gas and water droplets. sky glow is better seen during poor weather conditions where more particles are present in the atmosphere. astronomers are having increasing problems with sky glow as it interferes with the viewing of celestial objects. for example at the mars hill observatory in flagstaff arizona sky brightness is reported to have increased by. magnitude from to source. what is sky glow the lighting research center. glare this is the effect produced when the eyes are exposed to bright light. if a bright flashlight is directed at your face in a dark place you notice that it almost blinds you and suddenly you can not see other objects or shadows around you. this is particularly dangerous when driving because bright lights from cars coming towards you reduce your vision and puts pedestrians and other road users at risk. the most common causes of glare include bright streetlights and car lights. see

until recently. the good news is that the solutions that experts suggest are not as complex and difficult as those of air and water pollution. light pollution can be significantly reduced by some engineering and structural design policies and considerations. besides that education will be needed to get the message across and get people more informed about the issue and take the step of becoming part of the solution. here are a few things governments and engineers can do engineers must invest and use new lighting technology that uses the full cut off concept. this way lights escaping upwards from large commercial places stadiums theaters and public places will be reduced. for example about of road light fittings in the uk have reached their lifespan and need changing. this is a good time to engage new technology to ensure that the replaced fittings will not cause too much light pollution government policies on the use of lights must be stepped in a way that forces consumers to buy more energy reduced light. these policies must be enforced. research shows that too much lights does not necessarily improve visibility. this means that smart choices can be made to improve visibility in the night without splashing too much light into the sky. individuals must also begin to install motion sensor lights and bulbs in their homes so that they are not kept on all night. garden and landscape lights must be used effectively and should not be too bright to bother others. it is important that education of light pollution and its consequences are stepped up and taught in all schools just as water land and air pollution. see other lessons available on eschooltoday national geographic society national geographic partners llc. all rights reserved pollutants in the air arent always visible and come from many different sources. pollutants in the air arent always visible and come from many different sources. published february despite decades of progress the air quality in the united states has started to decline over the past few years according to data provided in summer by the environmental protection agency. the agency recorded percent more days with unhealthy air in the country in and compared to the average from to. the reasons for the recent decline in air quality remain unclear says the agency but may be related to high numbers of wildfires a warming climate and increasing human consumption patterns driven by population growth and a strong economy. the long term outlook also remains unclear even as politicians debate air pollution standards. air pollution is a mix of particles and gases that can reach harmful concentrations both outside and indoors. its effects can range from higher disease risks to rising temperatures. soot smoke mold pollen methane and carbon dioxide are a just few examples of common pollutants. in the u. s. one measure of outdoor air pollution is the air quality index or aqi which rates air conditions across the country based on concentrations of five major pollutants ground level ozone particle pollution carbon monoxide sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide. some of those also contribute to indoor air pollution along with radon cigarette smoke volatile organic compounds formaldehyde asbestos and other substances. poor air quality kills people. worldwide bad outdoor air caused an estimated. million premature deaths in about percent of them in low and middle income countries according to the world health organization. indoor smoke is an ongoing health threat to the billion people who cook and heat their homes by burning biomass kerosene and coal. air pollution has been linked to higher rates of cancer heart disease stroke and respiratory diseases such as asthma. in the u. s. nearly million peopleover percent of the populationare at risk of disease and premature death because of air pollution according to american lung association estimates. while those effects emerge from long term exposure air pollution can also cause short term problems such as sneezing and coughing eye irritation headaches and dizziness. particulate matter smaller than micrometers pose higher health risks because they can be breathed deeply into the lungs and may cross into the bloodstream. air pollutants cause less direct health effects when they contribute to climate change. heat waves extreme weather food supply disruptions and other effects related to increased greenhouse gases can have negative impacts on human health. the u. s. fourth national climate assessment released in noted for example that a changing climate could expose more people in north america to ticks that carry lyme disease and mosquitoes that transmit viruses such as west nile chikungunya dengue and zika. though many living things emit carbon dioxide when they breathe the gas is widely considered to be a pollutant when associated with cars planes power plants and other human activities that involve the burning of fossil fuels such as gasoline and natural gas. thats because carbon dioxide is the most common of the greenhouse gases which trap heat in the atmosphere and contribute to climate change. humans have pumped enough carbon dioxide into the atmosphere over the past years to raise its levels higher than they have been for hundreds of thousands of years. other greenhouse gases include methane which comes from such sources as landfills the natural gas industry and gas emitted by livestockand chlorofluorocarbons which were used in refrigerants and aerosol propellants until they were banned in the late s because of their deteriorating effect on earths ozone layer. another pollutant associated with climate change is sulfur dioxide a component of smog. sulfur dioxide and closely related chemicals are known primarily as a cause of acid rain. but they also reflect light when released in the atmosphere which keeps sunlight out and creates a cooling effect. volcanic eruptions can spew massive amounts of sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere sometimes causing cooling that lasts for years. in fact volcanoes used to be the main source of atmospheric sulfur dioxide today people are. airborne particles depending on their chemical makeup can also have direct effects separate from climate change. they can change or deplete nutrients in soil and waterways harm forests and crops and damage cultural icons such as monuments and statues. countries around the world are tackling various forms of air pollution. china for example is making strides in cleaning up smog choked skies from years of rapid industrial expansion partly by closing or canceling coal fired power plants. in the u. s. california has been a leader in setting emissions standards aimed at improving air quality especially in places like famously hazy los angeles. and a variety of efforts aim to bring cleaner cooking options to places where hazardous cookstoves are prevalent. in any home people can safeguard against indoor air pollution by increasing ventilation testing for radon gas using air purifiers running kitchen and bathroom exhaust fans and avoiding smoking. when working on home projects look for paint and other products low in volatile organic compounds organizations such as green seal ul and the u. s. green building council can help. to curb global warming a variety of measures need to be taken such as adding more renewable energy and replacing gasoline fueled cars with zero emissions vehicles such as electric ones. on a larger scale governments at all levels are making commitments to limit emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. the paris agreement ratified on november is one effort to combat climate change on a global scale. and the kigali amendment seeks to further the progress made by the montreal protocol banning heat trapping hydrofluorocarbons in addition to cfcs. air pollution is the release of pollutants such as gases particles biological molecules etc. into the air that are harmful to human health and environment. air pollution refers to any physical chemical or biological change in the air. it is the contamination of air by harmful gases dust and smoke which affects the plants animals and humans drastically. there is a certain percentage of gases present in the atmosphere. an increase or decrease in the composition of these gases is harmful to survival. this imbalance in the gaseous composition has resulted in an increase in earth s temperature which is known as global warming. there are two types of air pollutants the pollutants that directly cause air pollution are known as primary pollutants. sulphur dioxide emitted from factories is a primary pollutant. the pollutants formed by the intermingling and reaction of primary pollutants are known as secondary pollutants. smog formed by the intermingling of smoke and fog is a secondary pollutant. also read water pollutionfollowing are the important causes of air pollution the combustion of fossil fuels emits a large amount of sulphur dioxide. carbon monoxide released by incomplete combustion of fossil fuels also results in air pollution. the gases emitted from vehicles such as jeeps trucks cars buses etc. pollute the environment. these are the major sources of greenhouse gases and also result in diseases among individuals. ammonia is one of the most hazardous gases emitted during agricultural activities. the insecticides pesticides and fertilizers emit harmful chemicals in the atmosphere and contaminate it. factories and industries are the main source of carbon monoxide organic compounds hydrocarbons and chemicals. these are released into the air degrading its quality. in the mining process the minerals below the earth are extracted using large equipments. the dust and chemicals released during the process not only pollute the air but also deteriorate the health of the workers and people living in the nearby areas. the household cleaning products and paints contain toxic chemicals that are released in the air. the smell from the newly painted walls is the smell of the chemicals present in the paints. it not only pollutes the air but also affects breathing. also read ozone layer depletionthe hazardous effects of air pollution on the environment include air pollution has resulted in several respiratory disorders and heart diseases among humans. the cases of lung cancer have increased in the last few decades. children living near polluted areas are more prone to pneumonia and asthma. many people die every year due to the direct or indirect effects of air pollution. due to the emission of greenhouse gases there is an imbalance in the gaseous composition of the air. this has led to an increase in the temperature of the earth. this increase in earth s temperature is known as global warming. this has resulted in the melting of glaciers and an increase in sea levels. many areas are submerged under water. the burning of fossil fuels releases harmful gases such as nitrogen oxides and sulphur oxides in the air. the water droplets combine with these pollutants become acidic and fall as acid rain which damages human animal and plant life. the release of chlorofluorocarbons halons and hydrochlorofluorocarbons in the atmosphere is the major cause of depletion of ozone layer. the depleting ozone layer does not prevent the harmful ultraviolet rays coming from the sun and causes skin diseases and eye problems among individuals. the air pollutants suspend on the water bodies and affect the aquatic life. pollution also compels the animals to leave their habitat and shift to a new place. this renders them stray and has also led to the extinction of a large number of animals species. following are the measures one should adopt to control air pollution people should avoid using vehicles for shorter distances. rather they should prefer public modes of transport to travel from one place to another. this not only prevents pollution but also conserves energy. a large number of fossil fuels are burnt to generate electricity. therefore do not forget to switch off the electrical appliances when not in use. thus you can save the environment at the individual level. use of energy efficient devices such cfls also controls pollution to a greater level. the use of solar wind and geothermal energies reduce air pollution at a larger level. various countries including india have implemented the use of these resources as a step towards a cleaner environment. other air pollution control measures include also

all know water is crucial for life we trash it anyway. some percent of the world s wastewater is dumpedlargely untreatedback into the environment polluting rivers lakes and oceans. this widespread problem of water pollution is jeopardizing our health. unsafe water kills more people each year than war and all other forms of violence combined. meanwhile our drinkable water sources are finite less than percent of the earth s freshwater is actually accessible to us. without action the challenges will only increase by when global demand for freshwater is expected to be one third greater than it is now. sip a glass of cool clear water as you read this and you may think water pollution is a problem... somewhere else. but while most americans have access to safe drinking water potentially harmful contaminantsfrom arsenic to copper to leadhave been found in the tap water of every single state in the nation. still we re not hopeless against the threat to clean water. to better understand the problem and what we can do about it here s an overview of what water pollution is what causes it and how we can protect ourselves. water pollution occurs when harmful substancesoften chemicals or microorganismscontaminate a stream river lake ocean aquifer or other body of water degrading water quality and rendering it toxic to humans or the environment. water is uniquely vulnerable to pollution. known as a universal solvent water is able to dissolve more substances than any other liquid on earth. it s the reason we have kool aid and brilliant blue waterfalls. it s also why water is so easily polluted. toxic substances from farms towns and factories readily dissolve into and mix with it causing water pollution. when rain falls and seeps deep into the earth filling the cracks crevices and porous spaces of an aquifer it becomes groundwaterone of our least visible but most important natural resources. nearly percent of americans rely on groundwater pumped to the earth s surface for drinking water. for some folks in rural areas it s their only freshwater source. groundwater gets polluted when contaminantsfrom pesticides and fertilizers to waste leached from landfills and septic systemsmake their way into an aquifer rendering it unsafe for human use. ridding groundwater of contaminants can be difficult to impossible as well as costly. once polluted an aquifer may be unusable for decades or even thousands of years. groundwater can also spread contamination far from the original polluting source as it seeps into streams lakes and oceans. covering about percent of the earth surface water is what fills our oceans lakes rivers and all those other blue bits on the world map. surface water from freshwater sources accounts for more than percent of the water delivered to american homes. but a significant pool of that water is in peril. according to the most recent surveys on national water quality from the u. s. environmental protection agency nearly half of our rivers and streams and more than one third of our lakes are polluted and unfit for swimming fishing and drinking. nutrient pollution which includes nitrates and phosphates is the leading type of contamination in these freshwater sources. while plants and animals need these nutrients to grow they have become a major pollutant due to farm waste and fertilizer runoff. municipal and industrial waste discharges contribute their fair share of toxins as well. there s also all the random junk that industry and individuals dump directly into waterways. eighty percent of ocean pollution originates on landwhether along the coast or far inland. contaminants such as chemicals nutrients and heavy metals are carried from farms factories and cities by streams and rivers into our bays and estuaries from there they travel out to sea. meanwhile marine debrisparticularly plasticis blown in by the wind or washed in via storm drains and sewers. our seas are also sometimes spoiled by oil spills and leaksbig and smalland are consistently soaking up carbon pollution from the air. the ocean absorbs as much as a quarter of man made carbon emissions. when contamination originates from a single source it s called point source pollution. examples include wastewater discharged legally or illegally by a manufacturer oil refinery or wastewater treatment facility as well as contamination from leaking septic systems chemical and oil spills and illegal dumping. the epa regulates point source pollution by establishing limits on what can be discharged by a facility directly into a body of water. while point source pollution originates from a specific place it can affect miles of waterways and ocean. nonpoint source pollution is contamination derived from diffuse sources. these may include agricultural or stormwater runoff or debris blown into waterways from land. nonpoint source pollution is the leading cause of water pollution in u. s. waters but it s difficult to regulate since there s no single identifiable culprit. it goes without saying that water pollution can t be contained by a line on a map. transboundary pollution is the result of contaminated water from one country spilling into the waters of another. contamination can result from a disasterlike an oil spillor the slow downriver creep of industrial agricultural or municipal discharge. aurora photos alamynot only is the agricultural sector the biggest consumer of global freshwater resources with farming and livestock production using about percent of the earth s surface water supplies but it s also a serious water polluter. around the world agriculture is the leading cause of water degradation. in the united states agricultural pollution is the top source of contamination in rivers and streams the second biggest source in wetlands and the third main source in lakes. it s also a major contributor of contamination to estuaries and groundwater. every time it rains fertilizers pesticides and animal waste from farms and livestock operations wash nutrients and pathogenssuch bacteria and virusesinto our waterways. nutrient pollution caused by excess nitrogen and phosphorus in water or air is the number one threat to water quality worldwide and can cause algal blooms a toxic soup of blue green algae that can be harmful to people and wildlife. used water is wastewater. it comes from our sinks showers and toilets and from commercial industrial and agricultural activities. the term also includes stormwater runoff which occurs when rainfall carries road salts oil grease chemicals and debris from impermeable surfaces into our waterwaysmore than percent of the world s wastewater flows back into the environment without being treated or reused according to the united nations in some least developed countries the figure tops percent. in the united states wastewater treatment facilities process about billion gallons of wastewater per day. these facilities reduce the amount of pollutants such as pathogens phosphorus and nitrogen in sewage as well as heavy metals and toxic chemicals in industrial waste before discharging the treated waters back into waterways. that s when all goes well. but according to epa estimates our nation s aging and easily overwhelmed sewage treatment systems also release more than billion gallons of untreated wastewater each year. big spills may dominate headlines but consumers account for the vast majority of oil pollution in our seas including oil and gasoline that drips from millions of cars and trucks every day. moreover nearly half of the estimated million tons of oil that makes its way into marine environments each year comes not from tanker spills but from land based sources such as factories farms and cities. at sea tanker spills account for about percent of the oil in waters around the world while regular operations of the shipping industrythrough both legal and illegal dischargescontribute about one third. oil is also naturally released from under the ocean floor through fractures known as seeps. radioactive waste is any pollution that emits radiation beyond what is naturally released by the environment. it s generated by uranium mining nuclear power plants and the production and testing of military weapons as well as by universities and hospitals that use radioactive materials for research and medicine. radioactive waste can persist in the environment for thousands of years making disposal a major challenge. consider the decommissioned hanford nuclear weapons production site in washington where the cleanup of million gallons of radioactive waste is expected to cost more than billion and last through. accidentally released or improperly disposed of contaminants threaten groundwater surface water and marine resources. to put it bluntly water pollution kills. in fact it caused. million deaths in according to a study published in the lancet. contaminated water can also make you ill. every year unsafe water sickens about billion people. and low income communities are disproportionately at risk because their homes are often closest to the most polluting industries. waterborne pathogens in the form of disease causing bacteria and viruses from human and animal waste are a major cause of illness from contaminated drinking water. diseases spread by unsafe water include cholera giardia and typhoid. even in wealthy nations accidental or illegal releases from sewage treatment facilities as well as runoff from farms and urban areas contribute harmful pathogens to waterways. thousands of people across the united states are sickened every year by legionnaires disease with cases cropping up from california s disneyland to manhattan s upper east side. todd mcinturf the detroit news apmeanwhile the plight of residents in flint michiganwhere cost cutting measures and aging water infrastructure created the recent lead contamination crisisoffers a stark look at how dangerous chemical and other industrial pollutants in our water can be. the problem goes far beyond flint and involves much more than lead as a wide range of chemical pollutantsfrom heavy metals such as arsenic and mercury to pesticides and nitrate fertilizersare getting into our water supplies. once they re ingested these toxins can cause a host of health issues from cancer to hormone disruption to altered brain function. children and pregnant women are particularly at risk. even swimming can pose a risk. every year. million americans contract health issues such as skin rashes pinkeye respiratory infections and hepatitis from sewage laden coastal waters according to epa estimates. in order to thrive healthy ecosystems rely on a complex web of animals plants bacteria and fungiall of which interact directly or indirectly with each other. harm to any of these organisms can create a chain effect imperiling entire aquatic environments. when water pollution causes an algal bloom in a lake or marine environment the proliferation of newly introduced nutrients stimulates plant and algae growth which in turn reduces oxygen levels in the water. this dearth of oxygen known as eutrophication suffocates plants and animals and can create dead zones where waters are essentially devoid of life. in certain cases these harmful algal blooms can also produce neurotoxins that affect wildlife from whales to sea turtles. chemicals and heavy metals from industrial and municipal wastewater contaminate waterways as well. these contaminants are toxic to aquatic lifemost often reducing an organism s life span and ability to reproduceand make their way up the food chain as predator eats prey. that s how tuna and other big fish accumulate high quantities of toxins such as mercury. marine ecosystems are also threatened by marine debris which can strangle suffocate and starve animals. much of this solid debris such as plastic bags and soda cans gets swept into sewers and storm drains and eventually out to sea turning our oceans into trash soup and sometimes consolidating to form floating garbage patches. discarded fishing gear and other types of debris are responsible for harming more than different species of marine life. meanwhile ocean acidification is making it tougher for shellfish and coral to survive. though they absorb about a quarter of the carbon pollution created each year by burning fossil fuels oceans are becoming more acidic. this process makes it harder for shellfish and other species to build shells and may impact the nervous systems of sharks clownfish and other marine life. it s easy to tsk tsk the oil company with a leaking tanker but we re all accountable to some degree for today s water pollution problem. fortunately there are some simple ways you can prevent water contamination or at least limit your contribution to it one of the most effective ways to stand up for our waters is to speak out in support of the clean water rule which clarifies the clean water act s scope and protects the drinking water of one in three americans. tell the federal government the u. s. army corps of engineers and your local elected officials that you support the clean water rule. also learn how you and those around you can get involved in the policymaking process. our public waterways serve every american. we should all have a say in how they re

may pose a threat to human health and or the environment. additionally water pollution may consist of chemicals introduced into the water bodies as a result of various human activities. any amount of those chemicals pollutes the water regardless of the harm they may pose to human health and the environment. many of the chlorinated solvents commonly used in industry are examples of such chemicals polluting our waters exclusively due to human activities. another example is mtbe a gasoline oxygenate that is currently banned in the u. s. regardless of their provenance the chemicals or biological agents causing water pollution are generically referred to as water pollutants. the chemical and biological agents represent the main causes of water pollution and are generically referred to as water pollutants. any kind of water can become polluted regardless of its size or location. this includes lakes from remote areas or huge water bodies and is due to the air transportation of pollutant particles and their transfer into precipitation water. the groundwater and surface water consist of swimming pools ponds lakes creeks rivers seas and oceans that may all become polluted at some point. due to the quick diffusion and dissipation of contamination and the faster natural degradation processes the bigger the water body is the shorter the time required for naturally cleansing the pollution and recovery. there are various types of water pollution based on the various causes of water pollution. various classifications can be made based on various water pollution causes. the type of the water pollutants based on this classification criteria water pollution can be i chemical when various chemicals are the water pollution causes. the following chemicals are the most common water pollutants ii radiological when radioactive materials are the water pollutant causes. iii biological when various microorganisms worms and or algae occurring in a large number are the water pollution causes. this type of pollution is caused by decaying organic material in water animal wastes as well as improper disposal of human wastes.. the type of the source of water pollutants these are localized sources like an industrial process a mining activity etc. these sources are usually regulated so that the effect may be predicted and the impact minimized. however accidental leaks and spills are an exception to that. these are unidentified sources from which pollutants are carried away by water discharges and runoffs. non point pollution may involve a broad range of pollutants but in lower amounts than the point sources. the main sources of pollution are all resulted from the disposal of chemical substances coming from medical industrial and household waste chaotic agricultural fertilizers disposal and accidental oil spills that pollute the water to a large extent. examples of major water pollutants that affect the health of humans are examples of major water pollutants that affect the ecosystem only are the following water pollution may cause a large variety of diseases and poses a serious problem for human health. this is mainly because we may get exposed to polluted water in various ways including but not necessarily limited to the effects of water pollution may appear immediately after exposure and be more or less violent in the case of drinking water with a high amount of pollutants. on the other hand the effects may appear some time after repetitive exposure to water contaminated with lower amounts of pollutants. the health effects of drinking contaminated water may range from simple intoxication and stomach aches to deadly diseases or sudden death. february read by usersaugust read by usersjune read by userscopyright www.

chinese fertilizer factory winds its way toward the yellow river. like many of the worlds rivers pollution remains an ongoing problem. from big pieces of garbage to invisible chemicals a wide range of pollutants end up in our planets lakes rivers streams and groundwaterand eventually the oceans. water pollutionalong with drought inefficiency and an exploding populationhas contributed to a freshwater crisis threatening the sources upon which we rely for drinking water and other critical needs. safeguarding water supplies is important because even though nearly percent of the world is covered by water only. percent of it is fresh. and just percent of freshwater is easily accessible with much of it trapped in remote glaciers and snowfields. water pollution can come from a variety of sources. pollution can enter water directly through both legal and illegal discharges from factories for example or imperfect water treatment plants. spills and leaks from oil pipelines or hydraulic fracturing operations can degrade water supplies. wind storms and litteringespecially of plastic wastecan also send debris into waterways. thanks largely to decades of regulation and legal action against big polluters the main cause of u. s. water quality problems is now nonpoint source pollution when pollutants are carried across or through the ground by rain or melted snow. this runoff can contain fertilizers pesticides and herbicides from farms and homes oil and toxic chemicals from roads and industry sediment bacteria from livestock pet waste and other pollutants. finally drinking water pollution can happen via the pipes themselves if the water is not properly treated as happened in the case of lead contamination in flint michigan and other towns. another drinking water contaminant arsenic can come from naturally occurring deposits but also from industrial waste. water pollution can result in human health problems poisoned wildlife and long term ecosystem damage. when agricultural and industrial runoff floods waterways with excess nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus these nutrients often fuel algae blooms that then create dead zones or low oxygen areas where fish and other aquatic life can no longer thrive. algae blooms can create health and economic effects for humans causing rashes and other ailments while eroding tourism revenue for popular lake destinations thanks to their unpleasant looks and odors. high levels of nitrates in water from nutrient pollution can also be particularly harmful to infants interfering with their ability to deliver oxygen to tissues and potentially causing blue baby syndrome. the united nations food and agriculture organization estimates percent of the european unions water bodies are under pressure from agricultural pollution. globally unsanitary water supplies also exact a health toll in the form of disease. at least billion people drink water from sources contaminated by feces according to the world health organization and that water may transmit dangerous diseases such as cholera and typhoid. in many countries regulation has restricted industry and agricultural operations from pouring pollutants into lakes streams and rivers while treatment plants make our drinking water safe to consume. researchers are working on a variety of other ways to prevent and clean up pollution. national geographic grantee africa flores for example has created an artificial intelligence algorithm to better predict when algae blooms will happen. a number of scientists are looking at ways to reduce and cleanup plastic pollution. national geographic fellow sandra postel views the world through a water lens advocating for all to make simple and easy changes to their everyday lives that will help

help protect watersheds by disposing of motor oil paints and other toxic products properly keeping them off pavement and out of the drain. be careful about what you flush or pour down the sink as it may find its way into the water. the u. s. environmental protection agency recommends using phosphate free detergents and washing your car at a commercial car wash which is required to properly dispose of wastewater. green roofs and rain gardens can be another way for people in built environments to help restore some of the natural filtering that forests and plants usually provide. published march what is water pollution water pollution is the contamination of water bodies very often by human activities. water pollution occur when pollutants are discharged directly or indirectly into water bodies without enough treatment to get rid of harmful compounds. pollutants get into water mainly by human causes or human factors. water pollution can be a point source non point source or transboundary in nature. water pollution is the second most imperative environmental concern along with air pollution. any change or modification in the physical chemical and biological properties of water that will have a detrimental consequence on living things is water pollution. the water pollution problem water covers over of the earth s surface. it is a very important resource for people and the environment. water is obviously crucial to human health. the who advises that at least. litres per day per person are necessary to meet the requirements of most people under most conditions and at least another litres per day to cover basic hygienic needs.. unep isbn number page as long as humans live water will be needed and consumed. this means humans are bound to create wastewater. it also means we will produce other non water items and the disposal of waste from that process will affect fresh water ad the environment in some way. water pollution affects drinking water rivers lakes and oceans all over the world. in many developing countries it is usually a leading cause of death by people drinking from polluted water sources. function popup cutelittlewindow window. open more to this water pollution affects not only individual living species but also populations and entire functioning ecosystems that exist in the waters. humans have now realised the importance of clean water as a foundation for life. in recent time more and more organisations and councils are working hard to educate protect restore waterways and encourage practices that help keep waters from contamination and also to preserve water ecosystems from destruction. by chris woodford. last updated march. over two thirds of earths surface is covered by water less than a third is taken up by land. as earths population continues to grow people are putting ever increasing pressure on the planets waterresources. in a sense our oceans rivers and other inland waters arebeing squeezed by human activitiesnot so they take up less room butso their quality is reduced. poorer water quality means water pollution. we know that pollution is a human problem because it is arelatively recent development in the planets history before the century industrial revolution people lived more in harmony with theirimmediate environment. as industrialization has spread around theglobe so the problem of pollution has spread with it. when earthspopulation was much smaller no one believed pollution would everpresent a serious problem. it was once popularly believed thatthe oceans were far too big to pollute. today with around billionpeople on the planet it has become apparent that there are limits. pollution is one of the signs that humans have exceeded those limits. how serious is the problem according to the environmental campaign organizationwwf pollution from toxic chemicals threatens life on this planet. every ocean and every continent from the tropics to the once pristine polar regions is contaminated. photo detergent pollution entering a river. photo courtesy of us fish wildlife service photo library. water pollution can be defined in many ways. usually it means oneor more substances have built up in water to such an extent that theycause problems for animals or people. oceans lakes rivers and otherinland waters can naturally clean up a certain amount of pollution bydispersing it harmlessly. if you poured a cup of black ink into ariver the ink would quickly disappear into the rivers much larger volume of clean water. the inkwould still be there in the river but in such a low concentration thatyou would not be able to see it. at such low levels the chemicals in the ink probably would not present any real problem. however if you poured gallons of ink into a river every few seconds through a pipe the river would quickly turn black. the chemicals in the ink could very quickly have an effect on the quality of the water. this in turn could affect the health of all the plants animals and humans whoselives depend on the river. photo pollution means adding substances to the environment that dont belong therelike theair pollution from this smokestack. pollution is not always as obvious as this however. thus water pollution is all about quantities how much of apolluting substance is released and how big a volume of water it isreleased into. a small quantity of a toxic chemical may have littleimpact if it is spilled into the ocean from a ship. but the same amountof the same chemical can have a much bigger impact pumped into a lakeor river where there is less clean water to disperse it. water pollution almost always means that some damage has been done to an ocean river lake or other water source. a united nations report defined ocean pollution as fortunately earth is forgiving and damage from water pollution is often reversible. when we think of earths water resources we think of hugeoceans lakes and rivers. water resources like these are called surfacewaters. the most obvious type of water pollution affects surfacewaters. for example a spill from an oil tanker creates an oil slickthat can affect a vast area of the ocean. not all of earths water sits on its surface however. a great dealof water is held in underground rock structures known as aquifers which we can not see and seldom think about. water stored underground in aquifers is known as groundwater. aquifers feed our rivers and supply much of our drinking water. theytoo can become polluted for example when weed killers used inpeoples gardens drain into the ground. groundwater pollution is muchless obvious than surface water pollution but is no less of a problem. in a study in iowa in the united states found that over half thestates groundwater wells were contaminated with weed killers. you might think things would have improved since then but two decades on all thats really changed is the name of the chemicalswere using. today numerous scientific studies are still finding weed killers in groundwater in worrying quantities a study discovered glyphosate in percent of groundwater samples from catalonia spain scientific opinion differs on whether this is safe or not. surface waters and groundwater are the two types of water resourcesthat pollution affects. there are also two different ways in whichpollution can occur. if pollution comes from a single location such asa discharge pipe attached to a factory it is known as point sourcepollution. other examples of point source pollution include an oilspill from a tanker a discharge from a smoke stack or someone pouring oil from their car down a drain. a great deal ofwater pollution happens not from one single source but from manydifferent scattered sources. this is called nonpoint sourcepollution. photo above point source pollution comes from a single well defined place such as this pipe. below nonpoint source pollution comes from many sources. all the industrial plants alongside a river and theships that service them may be polluting the river collectively. both photos courtesy of us fish wildlife service photo library. when point source pollution enters the environment the place mostaffected is usually the area immediately around the source. forexample when a tanker accident occurs the oil slick is concentratedaround the tanker itself and in the right ocean conditions thepollution disperses the further away from the tanker you go. this isless likely to happen with nonpoint source pollution which bydefinition enters the environment from many different places at once. sometimes pollution that enters the environment in one place has aneffect hundreds or even thousands of miles away. this is known as transboundarypollution. one example is the way radioactive waste travels throughthe oceans from nuclear reprocessing plants in england and france tonearby countries such as ireland and norway. some forms of water pollution are very obvious everyone has seen tvnews footage of oil slicks filmed from helicopters flying overhead. water pollution is usually less obvious and much harder to detect thanthis. but how can we measure water pollution when we can not see it howdo we even know its there there are two main ways of measuring the quality of water. one is totake samples of the water and measure the concentrations of differentchemicals that it contains. if the chemicals are dangerous or theconcentrations are too great we can regard the water as polluted. measurements like this are known as chemical indicators ofwater quality. another way to measure water quality involves examiningthe fish insects and other invertebrates that the water will support. if many different types of creatures can live in a river the quality is likely tobe very good if the river supports no fish life at all the quality isobviously much poorer. measurements like this are called biologicalindicators of water quality. most water pollution doesnt begin in the water itself. take the oceans around percent of ocean pollution enters our seas from the land. virtually any human activity can have an effect on the quality of ourwater environment. when farmers fertilize the fields the chemicalsthey use are gradually washed by rain into the groundwater or surfacewaters nearby. sometimes the causes of water pollution are quitesurprising. chemicals released by smokestacks can enter theatmosphere and then fall back to earth as rain entering seas rivers and lakes and causing water pollution. thats called atmospheric deposition. water pollution has many different causes and this is one of the reasons why it is such adifficult problem to solve. with billions of people on the planet disposing of sewage wasteis a major problem. according to figures from the world health organization some. billion people dont have access to safe drinking water while. billion dont have proper sanitation although there have been great improvements in securing access to clean water relatively little progress has been made on improving global sanitation in the last decade. sewage disposal affects peoples immediate environments and leads towater related illnesses such as diarrhea that kills children under five each year. in developed countries most people have flush toilets that takesewage waste quickly and hygienically away from their homes. yet the problem of sewage disposal does not end there. when youflush the toilet the waste has to go somewhere and even after itleaves the sewage treatment works there is still waste to dispose of. sometimes sewage waste is pumped untreated into the sea. until the early s around million tons of sewage was dumpedby barge from new york city each year. according to figures from the uk governments department forthe environment food and rural affairs the sewers of britain collect around billion liters of waste water every day there are still sewage overflow pipes through which in certain circumstances raw sewage is pumped untreated into the sea. the new river that crosses the border from mexicointo california once carried with it million gallons of raw sewage each day a new waste water plant on the us mexico border completed in substantiallysolved that problem. unfortunately even in some of the richest nations thepractice of dumping sewage into the sea continues. in early it was reported that the tiny island of guernsey has decided to continue dumping tons of raw sewageinto the sea each day. in theory sewage is a completely natural substance that should bebroken down harmlessly in the environment percent of sewage is water. in practice sewage contains all kinds of other chemicals from the pharmaceutical drugs people take tothe paper plastic and other wastes they flush down their toilets. when people are sick with viruses the sewage they produce carriesthose viruses into the environment. it is possible to catch illnessessuch as hepatitis typhoid and cholera from river and sea water. photo during crop spraying some chemicals will drain into the soil. eventually they seep intorivers and other watercourses. photo courtesy of us department of agriculture agricultural research service. suitably treated and used in moderate quantities sewage can be afertilizer it returns important nutrients to the environment such asnitrogen and phosphorus which plants and animals need for growth. thetrouble is sewage is often released in much greater quantities thanthe natural environment can cope with. chemical fertilizers used byfarmers also add nutrients to the soil which drain into rivers andseas and add to the fertilizing effect of the sewage. together sewageand fertilizers can cause a massive increase in the growth of algae orplankton that overwhelms huge areas of oceans lakes or rivers. thisis known as a harmful algal bloom. it is harmful because itremoves oxygen from the water that kills other forms of life leadingto what is known as a dead zone. the gulf of mexico has one ofthe worlds most spectacular dead zones. each summer accordingto studies by the noaa it grows to anarea of around square miles which isabout the same size as the state of connecticut. a few statistics illustrate the scale of the problem that wastewater cancause. around half of all ocean pollution is caused by sewage and wastewater. each year the world generates perhaps billion tons of industrialwaste much of which is pumped untreated into rivers oceans and otherwaterways. in the united states alone around factories takeclean water from rivers and many pump polluted waters back in theirplace. however there have been major improvements in waste watertreatment recently. since in the united states the environmental protection agency has invested about billion in improving water treatment plants that as of serve around percent of the us population. however another billion is still needed to update and upgrade the system. factories are point sources of water pollution but quite a lot ofwater is polluted by ordinary people from nonpoint sources this is howordinary water becomes waste water in the first place. virtually everyone pours chemicals of one sort or another down theirdrains or toilets. even detergents used inwashing machines anddishwashers eventually end up in our rivers and oceans. so do thepesticides we use on our gardens. a lot of toxic pollution also enterswaste water from highway runoff. highways are typically coveredwith a cocktail of toxic chemicalseverything from spilled fuel andbrake fluids to bits of worn tires and exhaust emissions. when it rains these chemicals washinto drains and rivers. it is not unusual for heavy summer rainstormsto wash toxic chemicals into rivers in such concentrations that theykill large numbers of fish overnight. it has been estimated that inone year the highway runoff from a single large city leaks as much oilinto our water environment as a typical tanker spill. some highway runoff runs away into drains others can pollute groundwater or accumulate in the land next to a road making it increasingly toxic as the years go by. detergents are relatively mild substances. at the opposite end of thespectrum are highly toxic chemicals such as polychlorinatedbiphenyls. they were once widely used to manufactureelectronic circuit boards but their harmful effects have now been recognized and their use is highly restricted in many countries. nevertheless an estimated half million tons of pcbs were dischargedinto the environment during the century. in a classicexample of transboundary pollution traces of pcbs have even been foundin birds and fish in the arctic. they were carried there through theoceans thousands of miles from where they originally entered theenvironment. although pcbs are widely banned their effects will befelt for many decades because they last a long time in the environmentwithout breaking down. another kind of toxic pollution comes from heavy metals such aslead cadmium and mercury. lead was once commonly used in gasoline though its use is now restricted in some countries. mercuryand cadmium are still used in batteries. until recently a highlytoxic chemical called tributyltin was used in paints toprotect boats from the ravaging effects of the oceans. ironically however tbt was gradually recognized as a pollutant boats paintedwith it were doing as much damage to the oceans as the oceans weredoing to the boats. the best known example of heavy metal pollution in the oceans tookplace in when a japanese factory discharged a significant amountof mercury metal into minamata bay contaminating the fish stocksthere. it took a decade for the problem to come to light. by that time many local people had eaten the fish and around were poisoned. hundreds of people were left dead or disabled. people view radioactive waste with great alarmand for good reason. at high enough concentrations it can kill in lower concentrations itcan cause cancers and other illnesses. the biggest sources ofradioactive pollution in europe are two factories that reprocess wastefuel from nuclear power plants sellafield on the north west coast of britain and cap la hague on thenorth coast of france. both discharge radioactive waste water into thesea which ocean currents then carry around the world. countries suchas norway which lie downstream from britain receive significantdoses of radioactive pollution from sellafield. the norwegian government has repeatedly complained that sellafield hasincreased radiation levels along its coast by times. both the irish and norwegian governments continue to press forthe plants closure. photo oil tanker spills are the most spectacular forms of pollution and the ones that catch public attention but only a fraction of all water pollution happens this way. photo courtesy of us fish wildlife service photo library. when we think of ocean pollution huge black oil slicks often springto mind yet these spectacular accidents represent only a tiny fractionof all the pollution entering our oceans. even considering oil byitself tanker spills are not as significant as they might seem only percent of the oil that enters the oceans comes from tanker accidents over percent of oil pollution at sea comes from routine shipping and from theoil people pour down drains on land. however what makes tanker spillsso destructive is the sheer quantity of oil they release at once inother words the concentration of oil they produce in one verylocalized part of the marine environment. the biggest oil spill inrecent years occurred when the tanker exxon valdez broke up inprince william sound in alaska in. around million gallons of oil were released into the pristine wildernessenough to fill your living room times over estimates of the marine animals killed in the spillvary from approximately sea otters and birds to as many as sea otters and sea birds. several billion salmon and herring eggs are also believed to have been destroyed. if youve ever taken part in a community beach clean youll knowthat plastic is far and away the most common substance that washes upwith the waves. there are three reasons for this plastic is one ofthe most common materials used for making virtually every kind ofmanufactured object from clothing to automobile parts plasticis light and floats easily so it can travel enormous distances acrossthe oceans most plastics are not biodegradable which means that things likeplastic bottle tops can survive in the marine environment for a long time. while plastics are not toxic in quite the same way as poisonouschemicals they nevertheless present a major hazard to seabirds fish and other marine creatures. for example plastic fishing lines andother debris can strangle or choke fish. about half of allthe worlds seabird species are known to have eaten plastic residues. in one study of shearwaters in the north pacific over percent of the birds were found to contain plastic residues in their stomachs. in the early s marine scientist tim benton collecteddebris from a km length of beach in the remote pitcairn islandsin the south pacific. his study recorded approximately a thousandpieces of garbage including pieces of plastic plastic bottles and two dolls heads. today much media attention focuses on the great pacific garbage patch a floating oceanic graveyard of plastic junk roughly three times the size of france discovered by sailor charles j. moore in. but as youll know well enough if youve ever taken part in a community beachclean persistent plastic litters every ocean on the planet some million tons of new plastic are dumped in the sea every single year. most peoples idea of water pollution involves things like sewage toxic metals or oil slicks but pollution can be biological as well aschemical. in some parts of the world alien species are a majorproblem. alien species are animals or plants from one region that have been introduced into adifferent ecosystem where they do not belong. outside their normalenvironment they have no natural predators so they rapidly run wild crowding out the usual animals or plants that thrive there. commonexamples of alien species include zebra mussels in the great lakes ofthe usa which were carried there from europe by ballast water. the mediterranean sea has been invaded by akind of alien algaecalled caulerpa taxifolia. in the black sea an alien jellyfishcalled mnemiopsis leidyi reduced fish stocks by percent afterarriving in ballast water. in san francisco bay asian clams called potamocorbulaamurensis also introduced by ballast water have dramaticallyaltered the ecosystem. in cornell universitys david pimentel estimated that alien invaders like this cost the us economy billion a year in the european commission put the cost to europe at billion a year and growingall the time. photo invasive species above water hyacinth crowding out a waterway around an old fence post. photo by steve hillebrand. below non native zebra mussels clumped on a native mussel. both photos courtesy of us fish wildlife service photo library. these are the most common forms of pollutionbut by no means theonly ones. heat or thermal pollution from factories and powerplants also causes problems in rivers. by raising the temperature itreduces the amount of oxygen dissolved in the water thus also reducingthe level of aquatic life that the river can support. another type of pollution involves the disruption of sedimentsthat flow from rivers into the sea. dams built for hydroelectric poweror water reservoirs can reduce the sediment flow. this reduces the formation of beaches increases coastal erosion and reduces the flow ofnutrients from rivers into seas. increased sediments can also present a problem. during construction work soil rock and other fine powders sometimes enters nearby rivers in large quantities causing it to become turbid. the extra sediment can block the gills of fish effectively suffocating them. construction firms often now take precautions to prevent this kind of pollution from happening. some people believe pollution is an inescapable result of humanactivity they argue that if we want to have factories cities ships cars oil and coastal resorts some degree of pollution is almostcertain to result. in other words pollution is a necessary evil that peoplemust put up with if they want to make progress. fortunately noteveryone agrees with this view. one reason people have woken up to theproblem of pollution is that it brings costs of its own thatundermine any economic benefits that come about by polluting. take oil spills for example. they can happen if tankers are toopoorly built to survive accidents at sea. but the economic benefit ofcompromising on tanker quality brings an economic cost when an oilspill occurs. the oil can wash up on nearby beaches devastate the ecosystem and severely affect tourism. the main problem is that the people whobear the cost of the spill arenot the people who caused the problem in the first place. yet arguably everyone who puts gasoline into their caror uses almost any kind of petroleum fueledtransportcontributes to the problem in some way. so oil spills are aproblem for everyone not just people who live by the coast and tankeroperates. sewage is another good example of how pollution can affect us all. sewage discharged into coastal waters can wash up on beaches and causea health hazard. people who bathe or surf in the water can fall ill ifthey swallow polluted wateryet sewage can have other harmful effectstoo it can poison shellfish that grownear the shore. people who eat poisoned shellfish risk suffering froman acuteand sometimes fatalillness called paralytic shellfishpoisoning. shellfish is no longer caught along many shores becauseit is simply too polluted with sewage or toxic chemical wastes thathave discharged from the land nearby. pollution matters because it harms the environment on which peopledepend. the environment is not something distant and separate from ourlives. its not a pretty shoreline hundreds of miles from our homes ora wilderness landscape that we see only on tv. the environment iseverything that surrounds us that gives us life and health. destroyingthe environment ultimately reduces the quality of our own livesandthat most selfishly is why pollution should matter to all of us. there is no easy way to solve water pollution if there were itwouldnt be so much of a problem. broadly speaking there are threedifferent things that can help to tackle the problemeducation laws and economicsand they work together as a team. making people aware of the problem is the first step to solving it. in the early s when surfers in britain grew tired of catching illnessesfrom water polluted with sewage they formed a group called surfersagainst sewage to force governments and water companies to clean uptheir act. people whove grown tired of walking the worlds pollutedbeaches often band together to organize community beach cleaningsessions. anglers who no longer catch so many fish have campaigned fortougher penalties against factories that pour pollution into ourrivers. greater public awareness can make a positive difference. one of the biggest problems with water pollution is itstransboundary nature. many rivers cross countries while seas spanwhole continents. pollution discharged by factories in one country withpoor environmental standards can cause problems in neighboringnations even when they have tougher laws and higher standards. environmental laws can make it tougher for people to pollute but to bereally effective they have to operate across national and internationalborders. this is why we have international laws governing the oceans such as the un convention on the law of the sea the london convention the marpol international convention for the prevention of pollution from ships and the ospar convention for the protection of the marineenvironment of the north east atlantic. the european union haswater protection laws that apply to all of itsmember states. they include the bathing water directive which seeks to ensure the quality of the waters that people use forrecreation. most countries also have their own water pollution laws. inthe united states for example there is thelean water actand the safe drinking water act. most environmental experts agree that the best way to tacklepollution is through something called the polluter pays principle. this means that whoever causes pollution should have to pay to clean itup one way or another. polluter pays can operate in all kinds of ways. it could mean that tanker owners should have to take out insurance thatcovers the cost of oil spill cleanups for example. it could also meanthat shoppers should have to pay for their plastic grocery bags as isnow common in ireland to encourage recycling and minimize waste. or itcould mean that factories that use rivers must have their water inletpipes downstream of their effluent outflow pipes so if they causepollution they themselves are the first people to suffer. ultimately the polluter pays principle is designed to deter people from pollutingby making it less expensive for them to behave in an environmentallyresponsible way. life is ultimately about choicesand so is pollution. we can livewith sewage strewn beaches dead rivers and fish that are toopoisonous to eat. or we can work together to keep the environment cleanso the plants animals and people who depend on it remain healthy. wecan take individual action to help reduce water pollution for example by using environmentally friendly detergents not pouring oil downdrains reducing pesticides and so on. we can take community actiontoo by helping out on beach cleans or litter picks to keep our riversand seas that little bit cleaner. and we can take action as countriesand continents to pass laws that will make pollution harder and theworld less polluted. working together we can make pollution less of aproblemand the world a better place. wherever possible ive

health problems and disorders in humans. it has also been shown to have drastically negative impacts on wild animals and the environment as a whole. there are quite a few different effects of the types of water pollution that are of significant importance to humans. water pollution can pose health dangers to humans who come into contact with it either directly or indirectly. the risks of your health being negatively impacted by polluted drinking water in a developed country is small in comparison with developing countries. however it is possible to become ill from contaminated water. when you are out hiking you can acquire giardiasis that can lead to the presentation of acute symptoms like vomiting and intense nausea. this infection is caused by drinking water that has been fouled by animal wastes in untreated waterways. in anthropogenic environments like cities and towns the potential toxins are far more numerous. the effects of agricultural runoff and land pollution have on waterways rivers streams and ultimately the ocean introduces toxic chemcials and livestock waste into water supplies and the ocean. hurricane damage and flooding of farms and farmlands have resulted in an ever increasing amount of toxic pollutants in water to the detriment of human marine and aquatic life. health risks from pollution vary from area to area. one of the most pervasive non localized water pollution issues facing the world today is the level of mercury in the oceans. inorganic mercury is a common byproduct of a number of industrial processes. the level of mercury in fish is mostly dangerous for small children and women who might become pregnant are pregnant or are nursing. mercury has been found to interfere with the development of the central nervous system in fetuses and young children which could potentially lead to a large amount of long term side effects. in louisiana water quality can be so bad in many waterways that fish advisories are often posted. people are warned against eating fish from these contaminated waterways. this is largely due to industrial runoff from localized sources and the accumulative effects of runoff and dumping from states that lie along the mississippi river. when the river empties into louisiana it brings those accumulated toxins with it. this is believed to lead to higher rates of cancer in areas surrounding the mississippi delta in an area that is colloquially referred to as cancer alley. phosphorous runoff from industry can get into waterways and create toxic algal blooms. these blooms have been linked to higher occurrences of paralytic shellfish poisoning in humans which can lead to death. according to the national park service the minnesota pollution control agency has taken on the project to clean up the mississippi river. the ambitious goal is to restore the river so it is once more fishable and swimmable. the mpca has teamed up with numerous partners to work on cleaning up the mississippi river and warns it will take several years to undo decades of damage. water pollution also causes negative effects within the environment to animals and their habitats. the entrance of pollutants into waterways can have a wide range of impacts. it is possible for the pollutants to raise the temperature of the water enough to force fish out in search of cooler waters. this can itself create an ecological deadzone. water pollution can also significantly increase the rate of algal blooms. these blooms create massive fish die offs as the oxygen in the water gets depleted and the fish suffocate. fish can also be killed when excessive algae get caught in their gills. oil spills are a common occurrence throughout the world however major spills like the exxon valdez and the bp deepwater horizon disaster have shown what water pollution can do on a very large scale. it was found that dolphins have been dying in record numbers near the site of the bp deepwater horizon disaster. it has also been found that the oil from the bp disaster has gotten into wetlands which are considered the nursery for nearly every creature that lives in the area. the effects of water pollution are not always immediate. they arent always seen at the point of contamination. they are sometimes never known by the person responsible for the pollution. however water pollution has a huge impact on the lives of all people. with knowledge consideration and preparation water pollution can be decreased. it doesnt take much effort just a little thought. our editors will review what you ve submitted and determine whether to revise the article. water pollution the release of substances into subsurface groundwater or into lakes streams rivers estuaries and oceans to the point where the substances interfere with beneficial use of the water or with the natural functioning of ecosystems. in addition to the release of substances such as chemicals or microorganisms water pollution may also include the release of energy in the form of radioactivity or heat into bodies of water. water bodies can be polluted by a wide variety of substances including pathogenic microorganisms putrescible organic waste plant nutrients toxic chemicals sediments heat petroleum and radioactive substances. several types of water pollutants are considered below. domestic sewage is the primary source of pathogens and putrescible organic substances. because pathogens are excreted in feces all sewage from cities and towns is likely to contain pathogens of some type potentially presenting a direct threat to public health. putrescible organic matter presents a different sort of threat to water quality. as organics are decomposed naturally in the sewage by bacteria and other microorganisms the dissolved oxygen content of the water is depleted. this endangers the quality of lakes and streams where high levels of oxygen are required for fish and other aquatic organisms to survive. sewage treatment processes reduce the levels of pathogens and organics in wastewater but they do not eliminate them completely. domestic sewage is also a major source of plant nutrients mainly nitrates and phosphates. excess nitrates and phosphates in water promote the growth of algae sometimes causing unusually dense and rapid growths known as algal blooms. when the algae die oxygen dissolved in the water declines because microorganisms use oxygen to digest algae during the process of decomposition. anaerobic organisms then metabolize the organic wastes releasing gases such as methane and hydrogen sulfide which are harmful to the aerobic forms of life. the process by which a lake changes from a clean clear conditionwith a relatively low concentration of dissolved nutrients and a balanced aquatic communityto a nutrient rich algae filled state and thence to an oxygen deficient waste filled condition is called eutrophication. eutrophication is a naturally occurring slow and inevitable process. however when it is accelerated by human activity and water pollution it can lead to the premature aging and death of a body of water. waste is considered toxic if it is poisonous radioactive explosive carcinogenic mutagenic teratogenic or bioaccumulative. sources of toxic chemicals include improperly disposed wastewater from industrial plants and chemical process facilities as well as surface runoff containing pesticides used on agricultural areas and suburban lawns. sediment resulting from soil erosion can be carried into water bodies by surface runoff. suspended sediment interferes with the penetration of sunlight and upsets the ecological balance of a body of water. also it can disrupt the reproductive cycles of fish and other forms of life and when it settles out of suspension it can smother bottom dwelling organisms. heat is considered to be a water pollutant because it decreases the capacity of water to hold dissolved oxygen in solution and it increases the rate of metabolism of fish. valuable species of game fish can not survive in water with very low levels of dissolved oxygen. a major source of heat is the practice of discharging cooling water from power plants into rivers the discharged water may be as much as c warmer than the naturally occurring water. petroleum pollution occurs when oil from roads and parking lots is carried in surface runoff into water bodies. accidental oil spills are also a source of oil pollutionas in the devastating spills from the tanker exxon valdez and from the deepwater horizon oil rig. oil slicks eventually move toward shore harming aquatic life and damaging recreation areas. groundwaterwater contained in underground geologic formations called aquifersis a source of drinking water for many people. for example about half the people in the united states depend on groundwater for their domestic water supply. although groundwater may appear crystal clear it may still be polluted by dissolved chemicals and by bacteria and viruses. sources of chemical contaminants include poorly designed or poorly maintained subsurface sewage disposal systems industrial wastes disposed of in improperly lined or unlined landfills or lagoons leachates from unlined municipal refuse landfills mining and petroleum production and leaking underground storage tanks below gasoline service stations. in coastal areas increasing withdrawal of groundwater can cause saltwater intrusion as the water table drops seawater is drawn into wells. although estuaries and oceans contain vast volumes of water their natural capacity to absorb pollutants is limited. contamination from sewage outfall pipes from dumping of sludge or other wastes and from oil spills can harm marine life especially microscopic phytoplankton that serve as food for larger aquatic organisms. sometimes unsightly and dangerous waste materials can be washed back to shore littering beaches with hazardous debris. by an estimated. million and. million tonnes of plastic debris had been dumped into the oceans annually and floating plastic waste had accummulated in earth s five subtropical gyres that cover percent of the world s oceans. another ocean pollution problem is the seasonal formation of dead zones in certain coastal areas. the cause is nutrient enrichment from dispersed agricultural runoff and concomitant algal blooms. dead zones occur worldwide one of the largest of these forms annually in the gulf of mexico beginning at the mississippi river delta. water pollutants come from either point sources or dispersed sources. a point source is a pipe or channel such as those used for discharge from an industrial facility or a city sewerage system. a dispersed source is a very broad unconfined area from which a variety of pollutants enter the water body such as the runoff from an agricultural area. point sources of water pollution are easier to control than dispersed sources because the contaminated water has been collected and conveyed to one single point where it can be treated. pollution from dispersed sources is difficult to control and despite much progress in the building of modern sewage treatment plants dispersed sources continue to cause a large fraction of water pollution problems. although pure water is rarely found in nature the characterization of water quality is a function of the intended use of the water. for example water that is clean enough for swimming and fishing may not be clean enough for drinking and cooking. water quality standards provide a legal framework for the prevention of water pollution of all types. there are several types of water quality standards. stream standards are those that classify streams rivers and lakes on the basis of their maximum beneficial use they set allowable levels of specific substances or qualities allowed in those bodies of water based on their given classification. effluent standards set specific limits on the levels of contaminants allowed in the final discharges from wastewater treatment plants. drinking water standards include limits on the levels of specific contaminants allowed in potable water delivered to homes for domestic use. in the united states the clean water act and its amendments regulate water quality and set minimum standards for waste discharges for each industry as well as regulations for specific problems such as toxic chemicals and oil spills. in the european union water quality is governed by the water framework directive the drinking water directive and other laws. browse section iconhumans are increasingly influencing the climate and the earths temperature by burning fossil fuels cutting down rainforests and farming livestock. this adds enormous amounts of greenhouse gases to those naturally occurring in the atmosphere increasing the greenhouse effect and global warming. some gases in the earths atmosphere act a bit like the glass in a greenhouse trapping the suns heat and stopping it from leaking back into space. many of these gases occur naturally but human activity is increasing the concentrations of some of them in the atmosphere in particular co is the greenhouse gas most commonly produced by human activities and it is responsible for of man made global warming. its concentration in the atmosphere is currently higher than it was when industrialisation began. other greenhouse gases are emitted in smaller quantities but they trap heat far more effectively than co and in some cases are thousands of times stronger. methane is responsible for of man made global warming nitrous oxide for. tthe current global average temperature is. c higher than it was in the late century. each of the past three decades has been warmer than any preceding decade since records began in. the worlds leading climate scientists think human activities are almost certainly the main cause of the warming observed since the middle of the century. an increase of compared to the temperature in pre industrial times is seen by scientists as the threshold beyond which there is a much higher risk that dangerous and possibly catastrophic changes in the global environment will occur. for this reason the international community has recognised the need to keep warming below. follow us models that account only for the effects of natural processes are not able to explain the warming observed over the past century. models that also account for the greenhouse gases emitted by humans are able to explain this warming. click the image to view a larger version. earths temperature depends on the balance between energy entering and leaving the planet s system. when incoming energy from the sun is absorbed by the earth system earth warms. when the sun s energy is reflected back into space earth avoids warming. when absorbed energy is released back into space earth cools. many factors both natural and human can cause changes in earth s energy balance including these factors have caused earth s climate to change many times. scientists have pieced together a record of earth s climate dating back hundreds of thousands of years by analyzing a number of indirect measures of climate such as ice cores tree rings glacier lengths pollen remains and ocean sediments and by studying changes in earth s orbit around the sun. this record shows that the climate system varies naturally over a wide range of time scales. in general climate changes prior to the industrial revolution in the s can be explained by natural causes such as changes in solar energy volcanic eruptions and natural changes in greenhouse gas concentrations. recent climate changes however can not be explained by natural causes alone. research indicates that natural causes do not explain most observed warming especially warming since the mid century. rather it is extremely likely that human activities have been the dominant cause of that warming. top of pageradiative forcing is a measure of the influence of a particular factor on the net change in earth s energy balance. on average a positive radiative forcing tends to warm the surface of the planet while a negative forcing tends to cool the surface. ghgs have a positive forcing because they absorb energy radiating from earth s surface rather than allowing it to be directly transmitted into space. this warms the atmosphere like a blanket. aerosols or small particles can have a positive or negative radiative forcing depending on how they absorb and emit heat or reflect light. for example black carbon aerosols have a positive forcing since they absorb sunlight. sulfate aerosols have a negative forcing since they reflect sunlight back into space. noaa s annual ghg index which tracks changes in radiative forcing from ghgs over time shows that such forcing from human added ghgs has increased. percent between and. increases in co in the atmosphere are responsible for of the increase. the contribution to radiative forcing by ch and cfcs has been nearly constant or declining respectively in recent years. when sunlight reaches earth s surface it can either be reflected back into space or absorbed by earth. once absorbed the planet releases some of the energy back into the atmosphere as heat. greenhouse gases like water vapor carbon dioxide and methane absorb energy slowing or preventing the loss of heat to space. in this way ghgs act like a blanket making earth warmer than it would otherwise be. this process is commonly known as the greenhouse effect. over the last several hundred thousand years co levels varied in tandem with the glacial cycles. during warm interglacial periods co levels were higher. during cool glacial periods co levels were lower. the heating or cooling of earth s surface and oceans can cause changes in the natural sources and sinks of these gases and thus change greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere. these changing concentrations are thought to have acted as a positive feedback amplifying the temperature changes caused by long term shifts in earth s orbit. estimates of the earth s changing co concentration and antarctic temperature based on analysis of ice core data extending back years. until the past century natural factors caused atmospheric co concentrations to vary within a range of about to parts per million by volume. warmer periods coincide with periods of relatively high co concentrations. note the past century s temperature changes and rapid co rise are not shown here. increases over the past half century are shown in the recent role section. click the image to view a larger version. source based on data appearing in nrc. climate feedbacks amplify or reduce direct warming and cooling effects. they do not change the planet s temperature directly. feedbacks that amplify changes are called positive feedbacks. feedbacks that counteract changes are called negative feedbacks. feedbacks are associated with changes in surface reflectivity clouds water vapor and the carbon cycle. water vapor appears to cause the most important positive feedback. as earth warms the rate of evaporation and the ability of air to hold water vapor both rise increasing the amount of water vapor in the air. because water vapor is a greenhouse gas this leads to further warming. the melting of arctic sea ice is another example of a positive climate feedback. as temperatures rise sea ice retreats. the loss of ice exposes the underlying sea surface which is darker and absorbs more sunlight than ice increasing the total amount of warming. some types of clouds cause a negative feedback. warming temperatures can increase the amount or reflectivity of these clouds reflecting more sunlight back into space cooling the surface of the planet. other types of clouds however contribute a positive feedback. there are also several positive feedbacks that increase ghg concentrations. for example as temperatures warm these changes lead to higher concentrations of atmospheric ghgs and contribute to increased warming. since the industrial revolution began around human activities have contributed substantially to climate change by adding co and other heat trapping gases to the atmosphere. these greenhouse gas emissions have increased the greenhouse effect and caused earth s surface temperature to rise. the primary human activity affecting the amount and rate of climate change is greenhouse gas emissions from the burning of fossil fuels. the most important ghgs directly emitted by humans include carbon dioxide methane nitrous oxide and several others. the sources and recent trends of these gases are detailed below. carbon dioxide is the primary greenhouse gas that is contributing to recent climate change. co is absorbed and emitted naturally as part of the carbon cycle through plant and animal respiration volcanic eruptions and ocean atmosphere exchange. human activities such as the burning of fossil fuels and changes in land use release large amounts of co causing concentrations in the atmosphere to rise. atmospheric co concentrations have increased by more than since pre industrial times from approximately parts per million by volume in the century to over ppmv in. the monthly average concentration at mauna loa now exceeds ppmv for the first time in human history. the current co level is higher than it has been in at least years. some volcanic eruptions released large quantities of co in the distant past. however the u. s. geological survey reports that human activities now emit more than times as much co as volcanoes each year. human activities currently release over billion tons of co into the atmosphere every year. the resultant build up of co in the atmosphere is like a tub filling with water where more water flows from the faucet than the drain can take away. for more information on the human and natural sources and sinks of co emissions and actions that can reduce emissions see the carbon dioxide page in the greenhouse gas emissions website. methane is produced through both natural and human activities. for example natural wetlands agricultural activities and fossil fuel extraction and transport all emit ch. methane is more abundant in earth s atmosphere now than at any time in at least the past years. due to human activities ch concentrations increased sharply during most of the century and are now more than two and a half times pre industrial levels. in recent decades the rate of increase has slowed considerably. for more information on ch emissions and sources and actions that can reduce emissions see epa s methane page in the greenhouse gas emissions website. for information on how methane is impacting the arctic see the epa report methane and black carbon impacts on the arctic. nitrous oxide is produced through natural and human activities mainly through agricultural activities and natural biological processes. fuel burning and some other processes also create no. concentrations of no have risen approximately since the start of the industrial revolution with a relatively rapid increase toward the end of the century. overall no concentrations have increased more rapidly during the past century than at any time in the past years. for more information on no emissions and sources and actions that can reduce emissions see epa s nitrous oxide page in the greenhouse gas emissions website.

strengths of greenhouse gases. to learn more about actions that can reduce these emissions see what you can do. particles and aerosols in the atmosphere can also affect climate. human activities such as burning fossil fuels and biomass contribute to emissions of these substances although some aerosols also come from natural sources such as volcanoes and marine plankton. for more information on greenhouse gas emissions see the greenhouse gas emissions website. to learn more about actions that can reduce these emissions see what epa is doing and what you can do. top of pagethe sun s energy received at the top of earth s atmosphere has been measured by satellites since. it has followed its natural year cycle of small ups and downs but with no net increase. over the same period global temperature has risen markedly. click the image to view a larger version. source usgcrp. climate is influenced by natural changes that affect how much solar energy reaches earth. these changes include changes within the sun and changes in earth s orbit. changes occurring in the sun itself can affect the intensity of the sunlight that reaches earth s surface. the intensity of the sunlight can cause either warming or cooling. the sun follows a natural year cycle of small ups and downs in intensity but the effect on earth s climate is small. changes in the shape of earth s orbit as well as the tilt and position of earth s axis can also affect the amount of sunlight reaching earth s surface. changes in the sun s intensity have influenced earth s climate in the past. for example the so called little ice age between the and centuries may have been partially caused by a low solar activity phase from to which coincided with cooler temperatures. the little ice age refers to a slight cooling of north america europe and probably other areas around the globe. changes in earth s orbit have had a big impact on climate over tens to hundreds of thousands of years. in fact the amount of summer sunshine on the northern hemisphere which is affected by changes in the planet s orbit appears to drive the advance and retreat of ice sheets. these changes appear to be the primary cause of past cycles of ice ages in which earth has experienced long periods of cold temperatures as well as shorter interglacial periods of relatively warmer temperatures. click to learn about how rates of climate change have varied over time. changes in solar energy continue to affect climate. however over the last year solar cycle solar output has been lower than it has been since the mid century and therefore does not explain the recent warming of the earth. similarly changes in the shape of earth s orbit as well as the tilt and position of earth s axis affect temperature on very long timescales and therefore can not explain the recent warming. when sunlight reaches earth it can be reflected or absorbed. the amount that is reflected or absorbed depends on earth s surface and atmosphere. light colored objects and surfaces like snow and clouds tend to reflect most sunlight while darker objects and surfaces like the ocean forests or soil tend to absorb more sunlight. the term albedo refers to the amount of solar radiation reflected from an object or surface often expressed as a percentage. earth as a whole has an albedo of about meaning that of the sunlight that reaches the planet is absorbed. absorbed sunlight warms earth s land water and atmosphere. reflectivity is also affected by aerosols. aerosols are small particles or liquid droplets in the atmosphere that can absorb or reflect sunlight. unlike greenhouse gases the climate effects of aerosols vary depending on what they are made of and where they are emitted. those aerosols that reflect sunlight such as particles from volcanic eruptions or sulfur emissions from burning coal have a cooling effect. those that absorb sunlight such as black carbon have a warming effect. natural changes in reflectivity like the melting of sea ice have contributed to climate change in the past often acting as feedbacks to other processes. volcanoes have played a noticeable role in climate. volcanic particles that reach the upper atmosphere can reflect enough sunlight back to space to cool the surface of the planet by a few tenths of a degree for several years. these particles are an example of cooling aerosols. volcanic particles from a single eruption do not produce long term change because they remain in the atmosphere for a much shorter time than ghgs. human changes in land use and land cover have changed earth s reflectivity. processes such as deforestation reforestation desertification and urbanization often contribute to changes in climate in the places they occur. these effects may be significant regionally but are smaller when averaged over the entire globe. in addition human activities have generally increased the number of aerosol particles in the atmosphere. overall human generated aerosols have a net cooling effect offsetting about one third of the total warming effect associated with human greenhouse gas emissions. reductions in overall aerosol emissions can therefore lead to more warming. however targeted reductions in black carbon emissions can reduce warming. top of page usgcrp. climate change impacts in the united states the third national climate assessment. richmond

as the present tend to be more stable than cooler glacial climates. for example earth s climate during the current interglacial period is more stable than the most recent glacial period. the glacial period was characterized by widespread large and abrupt climate changes. in contrast the previous interglacial period was similarly stable. periods of abrupt climate change abrupt climate change refers to sudden large changes in some major component of the climate system with rapid widespread effects. abrupt or rapid climate changes tend to frequently accompany transitions between glacial and interglacial periods. for example a significant part of the northern hemisphere particularly around greenland may have experienced very rapid warming of f f over several decades during and after the most recent ice age. abrupt climate changes occur when a threshold or tipping point in the climate system is crossed causing large changes or impacts to the climate. scientific data show that abrupt changes in climate at the regional scale have occurred throughout history and are characteristic of earth s climate system. warming from greenhouse gas emissions as well as other human changes to the earth system may increase the possibility of large and abrupt regional or global climatic events. contact us to ask a question provide feedback or report a problem. last updated on december global warming is the long term rise in the average temperature of the earths climate system. it is a major aspect of climate change and has been demonstrated by direct temperature measurements and by measurements of various effects of the warming. the terms global warming and climate change are often used interchangeably. however speaking more accurately global warming denotes the mainly human caused increase in global surface temperatures and its projected continuation but climate change includes both global warming and its effects such as changes in precipitation. while there have been prehistoric periods of global warming many observed changes since the mid century have been unprecedented over decades to millennia. the intergovernmental panel on climate change fifth assessment report concluded it is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid century. the largest human influence has been the emission of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide methane and nitrous oxide. climate model projections summarized in the report indicated that during the century the global surface temperature is likely to rise a further. to. c in a moderate scenario or as much as. to. c in an extreme scenario depending on the rate of future greenhouse gas emissions and on climate feedback effects. these findings have been recognized by the national science academies of the major industrialized nations and are not disputed by any scientific body of national or international standing. the effects of global warming include rising sea levels regional changes in precipitation more frequent extreme weather events such as heat waves and expansion of deserts. ocean acidification is also caused by greenhouse gas emissions and is commonly grouped with these effects even though it is not driven by temperature. surface temperature increases are greatest in the arctic which has contributed to the retreat of glaciers permafrost and sea ice. overall higher temperatures bring more rain and snowfall but for some regions droughts and wildfires increase instead. climate change threatens to diminish crop yields harming food security and rising sea levels may flood coastal infrastructure and force the abandonment of many coastal cities. environmental impacts include the extinction or relocation of many species as their ecosystems change most immediately the environments of coral reefs mountains and the arctic. societal responses to global warming include mitigation by emissions reduction adaptation to its effects and possibly climate engineering. countries work together on climate change under the umbrella of the united nations framework convention on climate change which has near universal membership. the ultimate goal of the convention is to prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. although the parties to the unfccc have agreed that deep cuts in emissions are required and that global warming should be limited to well below c in the paris agreement the earths average surface temperature has already increased by about half this threshold and current pledges by countries to cut emissions are inadequate to limit future warming. climate proxy records show that natural variations offset the early effects of the industrial revolution so there was little net warming between the century and the mid century when thermometer records began to provide global coverage. the ipcc has adopted the baseline reference period as an approximation of pre industrial global mean surface temperature. multiple independently produced instrumental datasets confirm that the decade was.. c warmer than the pre industrial baseline. currently surface temperatures are rising by about. c per decade. since the number of cold days and nights have decreased and the number of warm days and night have increased. historical patterns of warming and cooling like the medieval climate anomaly and the little ice age were not as synchronous as current warming but may have reached temperatures as high as those of the late century in a limited set of regions. past examples of climate change provide insight into modern climate change. although the most common measure of global warming is the increase in the near surface atmospheric temperature over of the additional energy stored in the climate system over the last years has warmed ocean water. the remainder of the additional energy has melted ice and warmed the continents and the atmosphere. the warming evident in the instrumental temperature record is consistent with a wide range of observations documented by many independent scientific groups for example in most continental regions the frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation has increased. further examples include sea level rise widespread melting of snow and land ice increased heat content of the oceans increased humidity and the earlier timing of spring events such as the flowering of plants. global warming refers to global averages with the amount of warming varying by region. since the pre industrial period global average land temperatures have increased almost twice as fast as global average temperatures. this is due to the larger heat capacity of oceans and because oceans lose more heat by evaporation. patterns of warming are independent of the locations of greenhouse gas emissions because the gases persist long enough to diffuse across the planet however localized black carbon deposits on snow and ice do contribute to arctic warming. the northern hemisphere and north pole have warmed much faster than the south pole and southern hemisphere. the northern hemisphere not only has much more land but the arrangement of land masses around the arctic ocean has resulted in the maximum surface area flipping from reflective snow and ice cover to ocean and land surfaces that absorb more sunlight and thus more heat. arctic temperatures have increased and are predicted to continue to increase during this century at over twice the rate of the rest of the world. as the temperature difference between the arctic and the equator decreases ocean currents that are driven by that temperature difference like the gulf stream are weakening. because the climate system has large thermal inertia it can take centuries for the climate to fully adjust. while record breaking years attract considerable public interest individual years are less significant than the overall trend. global surface temperature is subject to short term fluctuations that overlie long term trends and can temporarily mask or magnify them. an example of such an episode is the slower rate of surface temperature increase from to which was dubbed the global warming hiatus. throughout this period ocean heat storage continued to progress steadily upwards and in subsequent years surface temperatures have spiked upwards. the slower pace of warming can be attributed to a combination of natural fluctuations reduced solar activity and increased volcanic activity. by itself the climate system experiences various cycles which can last for years to decades or centuries. other changes are caused by external forcings. these forcings are external to the climate system but not always external to the earth. examples of external forcings include changes in the composition of the atmosphere solar luminosity volcanic eruptions and variations in the earths orbit around the sun. attributing detected temperature changes and extreme events to human caused increases in greenhouse gases requires scientists to rule out known internal climate variability and natural external forcings. therefore a key approach is to use physically or statistically based computer modelling of the climate system to determine unique fingerprints for all potential causes. by comparing these fingerprints with observed patterns and evolution of climate change and the observed evolution of the forcings the causes of the observed changes can be determined. scientists have determined that the major factors causing the current climate change are greenhouse gases land use changes and aerosols and soot. greenhouse gases trap heat radiating from the earth to space. this heat in the form of infrared radiation gets absorbed and emitted by these gases in the atmosphere thus warming the lower atmosphere and the surface. before the industrial revolution naturally occurring amounts of greenhouse gases caused the air near the surface to be warmer by about c than it would be in their absence. without the earths atmosphere the earths average temperature would be well below the freezing temperature of water. while water vapour and clouds are the biggest contributors to the greenhouse effect they increase as a function of temperature and are therefore considered feedbacks. increased concentrations of gases such as co ozone and no are external forcing on the other hand. human activity since the industrial revolution has increased the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere leading to increased radiative forcing from co methane tropospheric ozone cfcs and nitrous oxide. as of the concentrations of co and methane had increased by about and respectively since pre industrial times. in co readings taken at the worlds primary benchmark site in mauna loa surpassing ppm for the first time. these levels are much higher than at any time during the last years the period for which reliable data have been collected from ice cores. less direct geological evidence indicates that co values have not been this high for millions of years. global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions in were equivalent to billion tonnes of carbon dioxide. of these emissions was carbon dioxide from fossil fuel burning and industry was carbon dioxide from land use change which is primarily due to deforestation was from methane. was from nitrous oxide and. was from fluorinated gases. using life cycle assessment to estimate emissions relating to final consumption the dominant sources of emissions were food washing heating and lighting personal transport and freight and building construction. the emissions gap report issued by the united nations environment programme predicts that if emissions continue to increase at the same rate as they have in global temperatures would rise by as much as byhanging the type of vegetation in a region impacts the local temperature by changing how much sunlight gets reflected back into space called albedo and how much heat is lost by evaporation. for instance the change from a dark forest to grassland makes the surface lighter causing it to reflect more sunlight. humans change the land surface mainly to create more agricultural land. since the pre industrial era albedo has increased due to land use change which has a cooling effect on the planet. other processes linked to land use change however have had the opposite effect so that the net effect remains unclear. solid and liquid particles known as aerosols from volcanoes plankton and human made pollutants reflect incoming sunlight cooling the climate. from to a gradual reduction in the amount of sunlight reaching the earths surface was observed a phenomenon popularly known as global dimming typically attributed to aerosols from biofuel and fossil fuel burning. aerosol removal by precipitation gives tropospheric aerosols an atmospheric lifetime of only about a week while stratospheric aerosols can remain in the atmosphere for a few years. globally aerosols have been declining since removing some of the masking of global warming that they had been providing. in addition to their direct effect by scattering and absorbing solar radiation aerosols have indirect effects on the earths radiation budget. sulfate aerosols act as cloud condensation nuclei and thus lead to clouds that have more and smaller cloud droplets. these clouds reflect solar radiation more efficiently than clouds with fewer and larger droplets. this effect also causes droplets to be of more uniform size which reduces the growth of raindrops and makes clouds more reflective to incoming sunlight. indirect effects of aerosols are the largest uncertainty in radiative forcing. while aerosols typically limit global warming by reflecting sunlight black carbon in soot that falls on snow or ice can contribute to global warming. not only does this increase the absorption of sunlight it also increases melting and sea level rise. limiting new black carbon deposits in the arctic could reduce global warming by. c by. when soot is suspended in the atmosphere it directly absorbs solar radiation heating the atmosphere and cooling the surface. in areas with high soot production such as rural india as much as of surface warming due to greenhouse gases may be masked by atmospheric brown clouds. as the sun is the earths primary energy source changes in incoming sunlight directly affect the climate system. solar irradiance has been measured directly by satellites and indirect measurements are available beginning in the early s. there has been no upward trend in the amount of the suns energy reaching the earth so it can not be responsible for the current warming. physical climate models are also unable to reproduce the rapid warming observed in recent decades when taking into account only variations in solar output and volcanic activity. another line of evidence for the warming not being due to the sun is how temperature changes differ at different levels in the earths atmosphere. according to basic physical principles the greenhouse effect produces warming of the lower atmosphere but cooling of the upper atmosphere. if solar variations were responsible for the observed warming warming of both the troposphere and the stratosphere would be expected but that has not been the case. ozone in the lowest layer of the atmosphere the troposphere is itself a greenhouse gas. furthermore it is highly reactive and interacts with other greenhouse gases and aerosols. the response of the climate system to an initial forcing is increased by self reinforcing feedbacks and reduced by balancing feedbacks. the main balancing feedback to global temperature change is radiative cooling to space as infrared radiation which increases strongly with increasing temperature. the main reinforcing feedbacks are the water vapour feedback the icealbedo feedback and probably the net effect of clouds. uncertainty over feedbacks is the major reason why different climate models project different magnitudes of warming for a given amount of emissions. as air gets warmer it can hold more moisture. after an initial warming due to emissions of greenhouse gases the atmosphere will hold more water. as water is a potent greenhouse gas this further heats the climate the water vapour feedback. the reduction of snow cover and sea ice in the arctic reduces the albedo of the earths surface. more of the suns energy is now absorbed in these regions contributing to arctic amplification which has caused arctic temperatures to increase at more than twice the rate of the rest of the world. arctic amplification also causes methane to be released as permafrost melts which is expected to surpass land use changes as the second strongest anthropogenic source of greenhouse gases by the end of the century. cloud cover may change in the future. if cloud cover increases more sunlight will be reflected back into space cooling the planet. simultaneously the clouds enhance the greenhouse effect warming the planet. the opposite is true if cloud cover decreases. it depends on the cloud type and location which process is more important. overall the net feedback over the industrial era has probably been self reinforcing. roughly half of each years co emissions have been absorbed by plants on land and in oceans. carbon dioxide and an extended growing season have stimulated plant growth making the land carbon cycle a balancing feedback. climate change also increases droughts and heat waves that inhibit plant growth which makes it uncertain whether this balancing feedback will persist in the future. soils contain large quantities of carbon and may release some when they heat up. as more co and heat are absorbed by the ocean it is acidifying and ocean circulation can change changing the rate at which the ocean can absorb atmospheric carbon. a concern is that self reinforcing feedbacks will lead to a tipping point where global temperatures transition to a hothouse climate state even if greenhouse gas emissions are reduced or eliminated. a study tried to identify such a planetary threshold for self reinforcing feedbacks and found that even a c increase in temperature over pre industrial levels may be enough to trigger such a hothouse earth scenario. a climate model is a representation of the physical chemical and biological processes that affect the climate system. computer models are run on supercomputers to reproduce and predict the circulation of the oceans the annual cycle of the seasons and the flows of carbon between the land surface and the atmosphere. there are more than two dozen scientific institutions that develop climate models. models not only project different future temperature with different emissions of greenhouse gases but also do not fully agree on the strength of different feedbacks on climate sensitivity and the amount of inertia of the system. a subset of climate models add societal factors to a simple physical climate model. these models simulate how population economic growth and energy use affect and interact with the physical climate. with this information scientists can produce scenarios of how greenhouse gas emissions may vary in the future. scientists can then run these scenarios through physical climate models to generate climate change projections. climate models include different external forcings for their models. for different greenhouse gas inputs four rcps are used a stringent mitigation scenario two intermediate scenarios and one scenario with very high ghg emissions. models also include changes in the earths orbit historical changes in the suns activity and volcanic forcing. rcps only look at concentrations of greenhouse gases factoring out uncertainty as to whether the carbon cycle will continue to remove about half of the carbon dioxide from the atmosphere each year. the physical realism of models is tested by examining their ability to simulate contemporary or past climates. past models have underestimated the rate of arctic shrinkage and underestimated the rate of precipitation increase. sea level rise since was underestimated in older models but now agrees well with observations. the united states published national climate assessment notes that climate models may still be underestimating or missing relevant feedback processes. the environmental effects of global warming are broad and far reaching. they include effects on the oceans ice and weather and may occur gradually or rapidly. between and the global mean sea level rose on average by.. mm per year with an acceleration detected as well. over the century the ipcc projects that in a high emissions scenario the sea level could rise by cm. the rate of ice loss from glaciers and ice sheets in the antarctic is a key area of uncertainty since this source could account for of the potential sea level rise. increased ocean warmth is undermining and threatening to unplug antarctic glacier outlets potentially resulting in more rapid sea level rise. the retreat of non polar glaciers also contributes to sea level rise. global warming has led to decades of shrinking and thinning of the arctic sea ice making it vulnerable to atmospheric anomalies. projections of declines in arctic sea ice vary. while ice free summers are expected to be rare at. c degrees of warming they are set to occur once every three to ten years at a warming level of. c increasing the icealbedo feedback. higher atmospheric co concentrations have led to an increase in dissolved co which causes ocean acidification. furthermore oxygen levels decrease because oxygen is less soluble in warmer water an effect known as ocean deoxygenation. many regions have probably already seen increases in warm spells and heat waves and it is virtually certain that these changes will continue over the century. since the s droughts and heat waves have appeared simultaneously with increasing frequency. extremely wet or dry events within the monsoon period have increased in india and east asia. various mechanisms have been identified that might explain extreme weather in mid latitudes from the rapidly warming arctic such as the jet stream becoming more erratic. the maximum rainfall and wind speed from hurricanes and typhoons are likely increasing. long term effects of global warming on the timescale of centuries to millennia the magnitude of global warming will be determined primarily by anthropogenic co emissions. this is due to carbon dioxides very long lifetime in the atmosphere. the emissions are estimated to have prolonged the current interglacial period by at least years. because the great mass of glaciers and ice caps depressed the earths crust another long term effect of ice melt and deglaciation is the gradual rising of landmasses a process called post glacial rebound. this could be facilitating seismic and volcanic activity in places like iceland. tsunamis could be generated by submarine landslides caused by warmer ocean water thawing ocean floor permafrost or releasing gas hydrates. sea level rise will continue over many centuries. abrupt climate change tipping points in the climate system climate change could result in global large scale changes. some large scale changes could occur abruptly i. e. over a short time period and might also be irreversible. one potential source of abrupt climate change would be the rapid release of methane and carbon dioxide from permafrost which would amplify global warming. another example is the possibility for the atlantic meridional overturning circulation to slow or shut down. this could trigger cooling in the north atlantic europe and north america. in terrestrial ecosystems the earlier timing of spring events as well as poleward and upward shifts in plant and animal ranges have been linked with high confidence to recent warming. it is expected that most ecosystems will be affected by higher atmospheric co levels and higher global temperatures. global warming has contributed to the expansion of drier climatic zones such as probably the expansion of deserts in the subtropics. without substantial actions to reduce the rate of global warming land based ecosystems risk major shifts in their composition and structure. overall it is expected that climate change will result in the extinction of many species and reduced diversity of ecosystems. rising temperatures push bees to their physiological limits and could cause the extinction of bee populations. the ocean has heated more slowly than the land but plants and animals in the ocean have migrated towards the colder poles as fast as or faster than species on land. just as on land heat waves in the ocean occur more due to climate change with harmful effects found on a wide range of organisms such as corals kelp and seabirds. ocean acidification threatens damage to coral reefs fisheries protected species and other natural resources of value to society. higher oceanic co may affect the brain and central nervous system of certain fish species which reduces their ability to hear smell and evade predators. the effects of climate change on human systems mostly due to warming and shifts in precipitation have been detected worldwide. the future social impacts of climate change will be uneven across the world. all regions are at risk of experiencing negative impacts with low latitude less developed areas facing the greatest risk. global warming has likely already increased global economic inequality and is projected to do so in the future. regional impacts of climate change are now observable on all continents and across ocean regions. the arctic africa small islands and asian megadeltas are regions that are likely to be especially affected by future climate change. many risks increase with higher magnitudes of global warming. crop production will probably be negatively affected in low latitude countries while effects at northern latitudes may be positive or negative. global warming of around c relative to late century levels could pose a large risk to global and regional food security. the impact of climate change on crop productivity for the four major crops was negative for wheat and maize and neutral for soy and rice in the years. up to an additional million people worldwide particularly those with lower incomes are at risk of hunger as a consequence of warming. while increased co levels help crop growth at lower temperature increases those crops do become less nutritious. based on local and indigenous knowledge climate change is already affecting food security in mountain regions in south america and asia and in various drylands particularly in africa. regions dependent on glacier water regions that are already dry and small islands are also at increased risk of water stress due to climate change. generally impacts on public health will be more negative than positive. impacts include the direct effects of extreme weather leading to injury and loss of life and indirect effects such as undernutrition brought on by crop failures. temperature rise has been connected to increased numbers of suicides. climate change may also lead to new human diseases. for example while ordinary temperatures usually kill off the yeast candida auris before it infects humans three strains have recently appeared in widely separate regions leading researchers to postulate that warmer temperatures are driving it to adapt to higher temperatures at which it can more readily infect humans. climate change has been linked to an increase in violent conflict by amplifying poverty and economic shocks which are well documented drivers of these conflicts. links have been made between a wide range of violent behaviour including fist fights violent crimes civil unrest and wars. in small islands and mega deltas inundation from sea level rise is expected to threaten vital infrastructure and human settlements. this could lead to homelessness in countries with low lying areas such as bangladesh as well as statelessness for populations in island nations such as the maldives and tuvalu. climate change can be an important driver of migration both within and between countries. the majority of severe impacts of climate change are expected in sub saharan africa and south east asia where existing poverty is exacerbated. current inequalities between men and women between rich and poor and between people of different ethnicity have been observed to worsen as a consequence of climate variability and climate change. existing stresses include poverty political conflicts and ecosystem degradation. regions may even become uninhabitable with humidity and temperatures reaching levels too high for humans to survive. mitigation of and adaptation to climate change are two complementary responses to global warming. successful adaptation is easier if there are substantial emission reductions. many of the countries that have contributed least to global greenhouse gas emissions are among the most vulnerable to climate change which raises questions about justice and fairness with regard to mitigation and adaptation. climate change can be mitigated through the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions or the enhancement of the capacity of carbon sinks to absorb greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. there is a large potential for future reductions in emissions by a combination of activities including energy conservation and increased energy efficiency the use of low carbon energy technologies such as renewable energy nuclear energy and carbon capture and storage decarbonizing buildings and transport and enhancing carbon sinks through for example reforestation and preventing deforestation. a report by citibank concluded that transitioning to a low carbon economy would yield a positive return on investments. over the last three decades of the twentieth century gross domestic product per capita and population growth were the main drivers of increases in greenhouse gas emissions. co emissions are continuing to rise due to the burning of fossil fuels and land use change. emissions can be attributed to different regions. the attribution of emissions from land use change is subject to considerable uncertainty. emissions scenarios estimates of changes in future emission levels of greenhouse gases depend upon uncertain economic sociological technological and natural developments. in some scenarios emissions continue to rise over the century while others have reduced emissions. fossil fuel reserves are abundant and will not limit carbon emissions in the century. emission scenarios can be combined with modelling of the carbon cycle to predict how atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases might change in the future. according to these combined models by the atmospheric concentration of co could be as low as or as high as ppm depending on the shared socioeconomic pathway the world takes and the mitigation scenario. near and long term trends in the global energy system are inconsistent with limiting global warming to below. or c relative to pre industrial levels. current pledges made as part of the paris agreement would lead to about. c of warming at the end of the century relative to pre industrial levels. to keep warming below c more stringent emission reductions in the near term would allow for less rapid reductions after. to keep warming under. c a far reaching system change on an unprecedented scale is necessary in energy land cities transport buildings and industry. co benefits of climate change mitigation may help society and individuals more quickly. for example bicycling reduces greenhouse gas emissions while reducing the effects of a sedentary lifestyle at the same time. the development and scaling up of clean technology such as cement that produces less co is critical to achieve sufficient emission reductions for the paris agreement goals. many integrated models are unable to meet the c target if pessimistic assumptions are made about the availability of mitigation technologies. it has been suggested that the most effective and comprehensive policy to reduce carbon emissions is a carbon tax or the closely related emissions trading. there are diverse opinions on how people could reduce their carbon footprint. one suggestion is that the best approach is having fewer children living car free forgoing air travel and adopting a plant based diet. some disagree with encouraging people to stop having children saying that children embody a profound hope for the future and that more emphasis should be placed on overconsumption lifestyle choices of the worlds wealthy fossil fuel companies and government inaction. climate change adaptation is the adjustment in natural or human systems in response to actual or expected climatic stimuli or their effects which moderates harm or exploits beneficial opportunities. examples of adaptation are improved coastline protection better disaster management and the development of more resistant crops. the adaptation may be planned either in reaction to or anticipation of global warming or spontaneous i. e. without government intervention. the public sector private sector and communities are all gaining experience with adaptation and adaptation is becoming embedded within certain planning processes. while some adaptation responses call for trade offs others bring synergies and co benefits. environmental organizations and public figures have emphasized changes in the climate and the risks they entail while promoting adaptation to changes in infrastructural needs and emissions reductions. adaptation is especially important in developing countries since they are predicted to bear the brunt of the effects of global warming. the capacity and potential for humans to adapt called adaptive capacity is unevenly distributed across different regions and populations and developing countries generally have less capacity to adapt. in june u. n. special rapporteur philip alston warned of a climate apartheid situation developing where global warming could push more than million more people into poverty by and will have the most severe impact in poor countries regions and the places poor people live and work. climate engineering is the deliberate modification of the climate. it has been investigated as a possible response to global warming by groups including nasa and the royal society. techniques studied fall generally into the categories of solar radiation management and carbon dioxide removal although various other schemes have been suggested. a study from investigated the most common climate engineering methods and concluded that they are either ineffective or have potentially severe side effects and can not be stopped without causing rapid climate change. as of nearly all countries in the world are parties to the united nations framework convention on climate change. the objective of the convention is to prevent dangerous human interference with the climate system. as stated in the convention this requires that greenhouse gas concentrations are stabilized in the atmosphere at a level where ecosystems can adapt naturally to climate change food production is not threatened and economic development can be sustained. the framework convention was agreed on in but global emissions have risen since then. its yearly conferences are the stage of global negotiations. during these negotiations the g pushed for a mandate requiring developed countries to the lead in reducing their emissions. this was justified on the basis that the developed countries emissions had contributed most to the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere per capita emissions were still relatively low in developing countries and the emissions of developing countries would grow to meet their development needs. this mandate was sustained in the kyoto protocol to the framework convention. in ratifying the kyoto protocol most developed countries accepted legally binding commitments to limit their emissions. these first round commitments expired in. united states president george w. bush rejected the treaty on the basis that it exempts of the world including major population centres such as china and india from compliance and would cause serious harm to the us economy. in several unfccc parties produced the copenhagen accord which has been widely portrayed as disappointing because of its low goals leading poor nations to reject it. parties associated with the accord aim to limit the future increase in global mean temperature to below c. in all un countries negotiated the paris agreement which aims to keep climate change well below c. the agreement replaced the kyoto protocol. unlike kyoto no binding emission targets are set in the paris agreement. instead the procedure of regularly setting ever more ambitious goals and reevaluating these goals every five years has been made binding. the paris agreement reiterated that developing countries must be financially supported. as of november states and the european union have signed the treaty and states and the eu have ratified or acceded to the agreement. in november the trump administration notified the un that it would withdraw the united states from the paris agreement in. in the british parliament became the first national government in the world to officially declare a climate emergency. as at september nine countries including the united kingdom france and argentina have made national declarations of a climate emergency. climate emergency declarations have been made in separate jurisdictions and local governments in countries covering million citizens. in november the european parliament declared a climate and environmental emergency. mario molina one of the scientists who discovered human caused ozone depletion and environmental policy advocate durwood zaelke have argued that the montreal protocol which was implemented to curb emission of ozone depleting substances may have done more than any other measure as of to mitigate climate change as those substances were also powerful greenhouse gases. in the scientific literature there is an overwhelming consensus that global surface temperatures have increased in recent decades and that the trend is caused mainly by human induced emissions of greenhouse gases. no scientific body of national or international standing disagrees with this view. scientific discussion takes place in journal articles that are peer reviewed which scientists subject to assessment every couple of years in the intergovernmental panel on climate change reports. the scientific consensus as of as stated in the ipcc fifth assessment report is that it is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid century. national science academies have called on world leaders for policies to cut global emissions. in november a second warning to humanity signed by scientists from countries stated that the current trajectory of potentially catastrophic climate change due to rising greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels deforestation and agricultural production particularly from farming ruminants for meat consumption is especially troubling. in the ipcc published a special report on global warming of. c which warned that if the current rate of greenhouse gas emissions is not mitigated global warming is likely to reach. c between and risking major crises. the report said that preventing such crises will require a swift transformation of the global economy that has no documented historic precedent. in november a group of more than scientists from countries named climate change an emergency that would lead to untold human suffering if no big shifts in action takes place. the emergency declaration emphasized that economic growth and population growth are among the most important drivers of increases in co emissions from fossil fuel combustion and that we need bold and drastic transformations regarding economic and population policies. the global warming problem came to international public attention in the late s. significant regional differences exist in how concerned people are about climate change and how much they understand the issue. in just a little over half the us population viewed it as a serious concern for either themselves or their families while of people in latin america and in developed asia felt this way. similarly in a median of of respondents considered it a very serious problem but americans and chinese were among the least concerned. worldwide in people were more likely to attribute global warming to human activities than to natural causes except in the us where nearly half of the population attributed global warming to natural causes. public reactions to global warming and concern about its effects have been increasing with many perceiving it as the worst global threat. in abs poll of the us population said that climate change is a crisis or a serious problem with saying human activity was a significant contributor. due to confusing media coverage in the early s issues such as ozone depletion and climate change were often mixed up affecting public understanding of these issues. although there are a few areas of linkage the relationship between the two is weak. from about onward american conservative think tanks had begun challenging the legitimacy of global warming as a social problem. they challenged the scientific evidence argued that global warming would have benefits warned that concern for global warming was some kind of socialist plot to undermine american capitalism and asserted that proposed solutions would do more harm than good. organizations such as the libertarian competitive enterprise institute as well as conservative commentators have challenged ipcc climate change scenarios funded scientists who disagree with the scientific consensus and provided their own projections of the economic cost of stricter controls. global warming has been the subject of controversy substantially more pronounced in the popular media than in the scientific literature with disputes regarding the nature causes and consequences of global warming. the disputed issues include the causes of increased global average air temperature especially since the mid century whether this warming trend is unprecedented or within normal climatic variations whether humankind has contributed significantly to it and whether the increase is completely or partially an artifact of poor measurements. additional disputes concern estimates of climate sensitivity predictions of additional warming what the consequences of global warming will be and what to do about it. in the century and early s some companies such as exxonmobil challenged ipcc climate change scenarios funded scientists who disagreed with the scientific consensus and provided their own projections of the economic cost of stricter controls. in general since the s global oil companies do not dispute that climate change exists and is caused by the burning of fossil fuels. as of however some are lobbying against a carbon tax and plan to increase production of oil and gas but others are in favour of a carbon tax in exchange for immunity from lawsuits which seek climate change compensation. protests in favour of more ambitious climate action have increased in the s in the form of fossil fuel divestment worldwide demonstrations and a school strike for climate. mass civil disobedience actions by extinction rebellion and ende gelnde have ended in police intervention and large scale arrests. litigation is increasingly used as a tool to strengthen climate action with governments being the biggest target of lawsuits demanding that they become ambitious on climate action or enforce existing laws. cases against fossil fuel companies from activists shareholders and investors generally seek compensation for loss and damage. in greco roman geography climate was thought to be simply set by klima the angle of the midday sun defining bands of latitude which suited different peoples. theophrastus thought agriculture caused local climate changes. colonists expected north american weather to match latitudes but found winters unexpectedly harsh. century naturalists starting with du bos in said millennia of farming had given europe the temperate climate needed for civilisation and cultivation could bring rapid climate improvements to america. thomas jefferson and others sought evidence of this warming. savants thought the earth had cooled from incandescent origins in buffon proposed climatic epochs of diminishing warmth shown by tropical fossils in the north. following from mariottes demonstration that glass though transparent to sunlight obstructs radiant heat de saussure showed that non luminous warm objects emitted obscure heat and in measured heat from the sun with a thermometer in a glass topped insulated box exposed to sunlight for an hour. in an innovative memoir summarising research into heat transfer joseph fourier assessed sources heating the globe and the balancing emission of infrared radiation. he proposed by analogy with de saussures device a simple formulation of what was later called the greenhouse effect transparent atmosphere lets through visible light which warms the surface. the warmed surface emits infrared radiation but the atmosphere is relatively opaque to infrared and slows the emission of energy warming the planet. in detailed research starting in john tyndall established that nitrogen and oxygen are transparent to infrared but water vapour and traces of complex molecules both absorb infrared and when warmed emit infrared radiation. his paper proposed changing concentrations of these gases could have caused all the mutations of climate which the researches of geologists reveal and would explain ice age changes. by then as humboldt noted in decades of climate measurements showed stability in north america rather than the expected improvement though popular belief that rain follows the plow continued. svante arrhenius noted that water vapour in air continuously varied but carbon dioxide was determined by long term geological processes. at the end of an ice age warming from increased co would increase the amount of water vapour amplifying its effect in a feedback process. in after laborious calculations he published the first climate model of its kind showing that halving of co could have produced the drop in temperature initiating the ice age. his source for geology arvid hgbom had estimated industrial carbon output and arrhenius calculated the temperature increase expected from doubling co. other scientists highlighted flaws ngstrm said that saturation of the greenhouse effect meant adding more co made no difference. experts thought climate would be self regulating. from guy stewart callendar published evidence that climate was warming and co levels increasing but his calculations met the same objections. s military research found less saturation of the greenhouse effect at high altitudes. earlier calculations treated the atmosphere as a single layer gilbert plass used digital computers to model the different layers and found added co would cause warming. hans suess found evidence co levels had been rising roger revelle showed the oceans would not absorb the increase and together they helped charles keeling to begin a record of continued increase the keeling curve. revelle plass and other scientists alerted media to press for government attention the dangers of global warming came to the fore at james hansensongressional testimony. scientific research on climate change expanded and the intergovernmental panel on climate change set up in to provide formal advice to the worlds governments has spurred unprecedented levels of exchange between different scientific disciplines. research in the s suggested that temperatures were increasing and a newspaper used the term climate change. this phrase next appeared in a november report in the hammond times which described roger revelles research into the effects of increasing human caused co emissions on the greenhouse effect a large scale global warming with radical climate changes may result. a mit report referred to the human impact as inadvertent climate modification identifying many possible causes. both the terms global warming and climate change were used only occasionally until when wallace smith broecker published a scientific paper on the topic climatic change are we on the brink of a pronounced global warming. the phrase began to come into common use and in mikhail budykos statement that a global warming up has started was widely reported. an influential national academy of sciences study headed by jule charney followed broecker in using global warming to refer to rising surface temperatures while describing the wider effects of increased co as climate change. there were increasing heatwaves and drought problems in the summer of and nasa climate scientist james hansens testimony in the u. s. senate sparked worldwide interest. he said global warming has reached a level such that we can ascribe with a high degree of confidence a cause and effect relationship between the greenhouse effect and the observed warming. public attention increased over the summer and global warming became the dominant popular term commonly used both by the press and in public discourse. in the s the term climate change increased in popularity. in technical sources the term climate change is also used to refer to past and future climate changes that persist for and extended period of time and includes regional changes as well as global change. people who regard climate change as catastrophic irreversible or rapid might label climate change as a climate crisis or a climate emergency. one newspaper the guardian has embraced this terminology in their editorial guidelines. in a statement explaining the papers policy editor in chief katharine viner said we want to ensure that we are being scientifically precise while also communicating clearly with readers on this very important issue. tar working

temperature has increased at the fastest rate in recorded history. and experts see the trend is accelerating all but one of the hottest years in nasa s year record have occurred sincelimate change deniers have argued that there has been a pause or a slowdown in rising global temperatures but several recent studies including a paper published in the journal science have disproved this claim. and scientists say that unless we curb global warming emissions average u. s. temperatures could increase by up to degrees fahrenheit over the next century. a global warming occurs when carbon dioxide and other air pollutants and greenhouse gases collect in the atmosphere and absorb sunlight and solar radiation that have bounced off the earth s surface. normally this radiation would escape into spacebut these pollutants which can last for years to centuries in the atmosphere trap the heat and cause the planet to get hotter. thats whats known as the greenhouse effect. in the united states the burning of fossil fuels to make electricity is the largest source of heat trapping pollution producing about two billion tons of co every year. coal burning power plants are by far the biggest polluters. the country s second largest source of carbon pollution is the transportation sector which generates about. billion tons of co emissions a year. curbing dangerous climate change requires very deep cuts in emissions as well as the use of alternatives to fossil fuels worldwide. the good news is that we ve started a turnaround co emissions in the united states actually decreased from to thanks in part to new energy efficient technology and the use of cleaner fuels. and scientists continue to develop new ways to modernize power plants generate cleaner electricity and burn less gasoline while we drive. the challenge is to be sure these solutions are put to use and widely adopted. a scientists agree that the earth s rising temperatures are fueling longer and hotter heat waves more frequent droughts heavier rainfall and more powerful hurricanes. in for example scientists said that an ongoing drought in californiathe state s worst water shortage in yearshad been intensified by percent to percent by global warming. they also said the odds of similar droughts happening in the future had roughly doubled over the past century. and in the national academies of science engineering and medicine announced that it s now possible to confidently attribute certain weather events like some heat waves directly to climate change. the earth s ocean temperatures are getting warmer toowhich means that tropical storms can pick up more energy. so global warming could turn say a category storm into a more dangerous category storm. in fact scientists have found that the frequency of north atlantic hurricanes has increased since the early s as well as the number of storms that reach categories and. in hurricane katrinathe costliest hurricane in u. s. historystruck new orleans the second costliest hurricane sandy hit the east coast in. the impacts of global warming are being felt across the globe. extreme heat waves have caused tens of thousands of deaths around the world in recent years. and in an alarming sign of events to come antarctica has been losing about billion metric tons of ice per year since. this rate could speed up if we keep burning fossil fuels at our current pace some experts say causing sea levels to rise several meters over the next to years. a each year scientists learn more about the consequences of global warming and many agree that environmental economic and health consequences are likely to occur if current trends continue. here s just a smattering of what we can look forward to a in recent years china has taken the lead in global warming pollution producing about percent of all co emissions. the united states comes in second. despite making up just percent of the world s population we produce a whopping percent of all global co emissionsas much as the european union and india combined. and america is still number one by far in cumulative emissions over the past years. our responsibility matters to other countries and it should matter to us too. a we ve started. but in order to avoid the worst effects of climate change we need to do a lot moretogether with other countriesto reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and start using clean energy instead. in the u. s. environmental protection agency pledged to reduce carbon pollution from our power plants by nearly a third by relative to levels through its clean power plan. but fast forward to and under the trump administration the epa proposed repealing this critical tool for curbing climate change. likewise while under the obama administration the u. s. department of transportation proposed carbon pollution and fuel economy standards intended to cut emissions through the s under trump administration the dot is working to roll back those clean vehicle safeguards that protect the climate and our health. fortunately state leadersincluding in car country itselfrecognize that clean transportation must remain a priority if we are to address the costly risks of climate change and protect public health. and regional efforts around the country are helping to boost the electric car market which saw an increase in sales for over. our clean energy economy is growing too despite federal efforts to derail it. in wind employment grew by percent and solar jobs increased by percent. globally at the united nations conference on climate change in paris countriesincluding the united states at the timeagreed to pollution cutting provisions with a goal of preventing the average global temperature from rising more than. degrees celsius above preindustrial times. to help make the deal happen the obama administration pledged billion to the green climate fund an international organization dedicated to helping poor countries adopt cleaner energy technologies. under the terms of the paris agreement participating nations will meet every five years starting in to revise their plans for cutting co emissions. beginning in they will also have to publicly report their progress. while in president trump announced the country s withdrawal from the paris climate agreement and to eliminate harmful and unnecessary policies such as the climate action plan americans are forging ahead without him. through initiatives like the united states climate alliance the regional greenhouse gas initiative we are still in and climate mayors state business and local leaders have pledged to honor and uphold the goals of the paris agreement. more than cities in states with populations totaling more than million have adopted resolutions that will enable them to get percent of their electricity from renewable sources like wind and solar. even better a new initiative by former new york city mayor michael bloomberg gives the urban layer of this movement a boost. he s asked mayors from the most populous cities in the country to share their plans for making their buildings and transportation systems run cleaner and more efficiently. the that show the greatest potential for cutting the dangerous carbon pollution that s driving climate change will share a total of million in technical assistance funding provided by bloomberg philanthropies and partners. a wondering how to stop global warming reduce your own carbon footprint by following a few easy steps. make conserving energy a part of your daily routine and your decisions as a consumer. when you shop for new appliances like refrigerators washers and dryers look for products with the government s energy star label they meet a higher standard for energy efficiency than the minimum federal requirements. when you buy a car look for one with the highest gas mileage and lowest emissions. you can also reduce your emissions by taking public transportation or carpooling when possible. and while new federal and state standards are a step in the right direction much more needs to be done. voice your support of climate friendly and climate change preparedness policies and tell your representatives that transitioning from dirty fossil fuels to clean power should be a top prioritybecause it s vital to building healthy more secure communities. the western city of ahmedabad is preparing residents to cope with the longer and more intense heat waves sweeping across south asiaand inspiring other indian cities and states to follow suit. by increasing the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere we re amplifying the planet s natural greenhouse effect and turning up the dial on global warming. the most widespread damaging storms on earth are

the environment. human healthwe all drink water that comes from a source this may be a lake or local river. in countries that have poor screening and purification practices people often get water borne disease outbreaks such as cholera and tuberculosis. every year there are an estimated million cholera cases and deaths due to cholera. in developed countries even where there are better purification methods people still suffer from the health effects of water pollution. take toxins emitted by algae growth for instance this can cause stomach aches and rashes. excess nitrogen in drinking water also poses serious risks to infants. epa s nationallakes assessment found that almost per cent of the nation s lakes have high levels of nitrogen and phosphorus pollution. the report also showed that poor lake conditions related to nitrogen or phosphorus pollution doubled the likelihood of poor ecosystem health.. ecosystemsnutrient pollution from upstream often flow downhill and even travel miles into other larger water bodies. the effect is that it breeds algae growth and causes the growth of many more water organism. this algae attack affects fish and other aquatic animals by absorbing and reducing their oxygen supply. algae growth also clogs fish gills. naturally the order of ecosystems in that water are affected negatively as the destruction or introduction of any foreign organism alter the entire food chain in there.. death of animalsanimals including water animals die when water is poisoned for various reasons. other animals are stressed and their populations are endangered. in a classic case of marine pollution in recent time miles of a us coastline was affected by an oil spill. that water pollution caused a lot of damage and deaths of many animals. over animals were reported dead just months after the spill including many that are already on the endangered species list. immediate impact on the wildlife includes oil coated birds and sea turtles mammal ingestion of oil and dead or dying deep sea coral. animals are also affected by solid waste thrown into water bodies as they harm them in many ways.. economic costfrom the above it is evident that there is some real financial implications that will result from water pollution. it can cost a lot more to purify drinking water that takes its source from nutrient polluted water bodies. fishing stock is affected negatively when there is a depletion of oxygen. consumers are also wary of fish from these sources and tend to stay away from them costing fisheries to lose revenue. in places where there are water activities or sports lots of money is spent to clean up the water from algae blooms and the like. the u. s. tourism industry loses close to billion each year mostly from losses in fishing and recreational activities because of nutrient polluted water bodies. in mississippi alone tourism in the three counties that border the gulf coast accounts for about. billion in visitor expenditures percent of state travel and tourism tax revenues and direct jobs. imagine this picture unep reports that around the world onethis is the idea of not making too much wasteconsidering the

is a major initiator of development and urbanization. although the merits of industrialization are innumerable it has been identified as a major threat to the environment as it releases various toxic chemicals gases solid wastes as well as microbes of various kinds into our immediate environmentland air and water. of particular interest is water pollution which has become a global challenge developing nations being highly affected due to their drive for development. pollution of our water bodies poses a great threat to humans and the aquatic ecosystem while marked population increase catalyzes climatic changes. for instance various human activities as well as the release of greenhouse gases by industries greatly contributes to global warming planet temperature enhancement and lowering of atmospheric air quality. the drive for sustainable development must bring along water pollution prevention techniques. effective wastewater treatment before their eventual discharge is one way to driving water pollution prevention. some remediate climate change mitigation measures against water pollution can also be explored. this chapter is aimed at critically discussing water pollution effects viz a viz global challenges threat and climatic impacts while also focusing on various possible preventive measures. sustainable development in any society is an access to initiate a good standard of living for the populace. it aims at providing solutions to the economic environmental and societal challenges without posing a threat to human and environmental future development that is we must consider the future as we make present decisions. also these include social progress and equality environmental protection conservation of natural resources and stable economic growth. there are numerous instances where urbanization has destroyed the environment and threatened its survival chances. sustainable development put into consideration how we survive in the natural world protecting it from destruction and damages. one of the major challenges of urbanization is sustainability as most developed or developing society now revitalizes a lot of natural resources daily. most of these resources meet the needs of man but they are also limited. sustainable development tends to balance the competing needs of the society. in achieving this many science bodies and institutions have seen the requisite of sustainable development and have set goals and targets to meet it. this also has pushed such institutions to have a role in measuring and monitoring the impact of these goals on the society. however the contribution of scientist in sustainable development should not only focus on the environment. it should also take into consideration the health of the populace in ensuring that no area of life suffers. while sustainable development may mean different things to different people environmental sustainability is all encompassing. it is directly concerned with the future of humanity and it defines how we should protect and handle the sustainability of resources air quality water quality and ecosystems. it also helps to prevent the environment from impending damage from technological advancement. one way to achieving environmental sustainability is via effective wastewater treatment. various conventional wastewater treatment methods are available their characteristics vary from complexities of operations through sludge generations among other things to various inadequacies. their economic disadvantages are widely related to expensive equipment complexities of operations and skilful manpower requirement. many industries avoid the conventional wastewater treatment methods due to their economic disadvantages hence discharging untreated or fairly treated wastewater into the water bodies. a simple and cheap wastewater treatment method will therefore facilitate effective wastewater treatment and protect the water environment from pollution. water is an essential and general need of life with an undeniable effect directly or indirectly. all industrial environmental and metabolic processes are water dependent. in living organisms water plays a number of roles such as solvent temperature buffer metabolite living environment and lubricants. water however is said to be polluted when some of the water quality parameters have been hampered by unguided and irregularities from several anthropogenic activities thus rendering water unfit for intended use. water pollution may pose serious threat to the environment as well as lives. pollutant effects may vary depending on their types and source. for instance while heavy metals dyes and some other organic pollutants have been identified as carcinogens hormones pharmaceuticals and cosmetics and personal care product wastes are known as endocrine disruptive chemicals. these pollutants which enter into the water body through various channel but predominantly anthropogenic have become a great concern to environmentalists due to various hazard they pose on the environment. heavy metals top the list of inorganic pollutant with wide range of negative effects on aquatic organisms plants and human. heavy metals are released into the environment via different routes such as industries mining activities agricultural activities etc.. bioavailable metals present in the soil may be absorbed by plants resulting in serious plant metabolism dysfunctioning. high heavy metal ion concentrations are also known to damage the cell membrane affect enzyme involved in chlorophyll production thus reducing photosynthetic rate as well as affect plant reproduction via decrease in pollen and seed viability. humans and animals can be exposed to heavy metal toxicity through the food web direct consumption of water containing metal or via inhalation. heavy metals readily bioaccumulates in vegetables and enters into man and animal through food chain. effects of heavy metal toxicity on human ranges from mild eye nose and skin irritations through severe headache stomach ache diarrhea hematemesis vomiting dizziness to organ dysfunctioning such as cirrhosis necrosis low blood pressure hypertension and gastrointestinal distress. while some heavy metals also called essential elements are required in minute amount in the body for various biochemical processes others such as lead cadmium arsenic and mercury are of serious threat and considered foreign in the body. looking at specifics human ingestion of water polluted with arsenic can cause cancer of the lungs liver and bladder. kidney and lungs damage as well as bone fragility may result when cadmium containing water is ingested. exposure to lead can severely damage the brain and kidneys. in children lead exposure even at very low concentration may hamper learning cause memory loss affect attention and response functions and generally make children aggressive. in pregnant women high levels of exposure to lead may cause miscarriage whereas in men it can damage the organs responsible for sperm production. mercury is unique amidst other heavy metals it has the capacity to travel a wide range of distance thus have been classified as a global pollutants. the chemical form of mercury in the environment is also important in analyzing their toxicity. the organic form of mercury that is methyl mercury and dimethyl mercury is known to be more toxic than inorganic mercury. while inhaled mercury goes into the blood stream their elimination from the body is either through the urine or faeces. mercury has the ability to exist in the urine for about months hence their renal dysfunctioning characteristic. many physiological disorders may accompany crustaceans exposure to metals and instant metabolic activities alterations. exposure of crustaceans to heavy metals may also result in loss of appetite for food and subsequently body weight loss. continuous exposure may reduce reproduction in adults as well as hamper the growth larvae. organic pollutants are very wide in variety with a huge range of toxicity. among the list of organic pollutants that has been of great threat to aquatic organisms plants and humans are dyes plant and animal pharmaceuticals personal care products wastes as well as petroleum organic pollutants. a group of chemicals referred to as endocrine disruptive chemicals also belongs to the organic pollutants group which are classed as emerging contaminants. edcs are described as external agents that interfere with hormonal activities thus affecting the normal homeostatic reproduction development or behavior. dyes are water soluble giant chemical that is greatly used in many industries viz textile leather and tanning food paper etc. to impact color on products. aquatic organisms plants and humans are greatly affected by dyes presence in water. they impede sunlight penetration into water bodies and reduce dissolved oxygen thus leading to death of photosynthetic organism and other lives within the aquatic environment. humans may be exposed to dye toxicity via consumption of vegetables and fish which bioaccumulate dyes. the use of colored paper towels used in drying hands and in food preparation is another route of exposure to human. dyes are considered as carcinogenic and mutagenic thus their removal from wastewater before disposal is ultimately important. human and veterinary pharmaceuticals which are members of edcs are chemicals used as curative or preventive of various diseases. veterinary pharmaceutical may also serve the purpose of increasing efficiency of food production. pharmaceuticals are used widely and unavoidably thus they enter into the environment through one of these routes indiscriminate disposal of hospital and household waste landfill leaching drainage water and sewage. although pharmaceuticals have been found to exist in various environmental samples at the ng l to g l levels it is considered a great threat to both aquatic lives and humans. the presence of pharmaceuticals in water is known to pose both acute and chronic toxicity on aquatic organisms. edcs as their name implies causes abnormal endocrine activities and increase cancer risk in human. their effects on aquatic lives may range from endocrine system disruption through the reduction in eggs and sperm cells production to feminization of female aquatics. water is one important part of our day to day activities and their preservation can never be overemphasized. three quarter of the fluid in man is made of water and it forms the essential medium in which the biochemical reactions take place in human body. water moves blood from one place to the other in the body and helps in digestion electrically charged ions which generate nerve signals that make the human brain possible are also held and transported by water. water is a good solvent and it is usually referred to as universal solvent all the major components in cells that is protein deoxyribonucleic acid and polysaccharides are all soluble in water. pure water is tasteless odorless and transparent and thus provides a habitat for aquatic plants and organisms because sunlight can reach them within the water. though clean water is a vital commodity for the well being of human but unfortunately the availability of fresh water is unevenly distributed and greatly threatened where available due to problems associated with climate change inefficient water management and pollution. recent report says very high percentage of the world population still lacks water for human well being and ecosystem conservation. the world is faced with the dilemma of achieving balance between economic development and sustainable natural environment. effective wastewater treatment has been earlier identified a way of protecting the water environment with detailed discussion on effective cheap and accessible method of wastewater treatment. various other methods of water purification such as forward and or reverse osmosis precipitations coagulation filtrations modular anaerobic system microbial fuel cell and advanced oxidation process with their attendant challenges have been reported in literature. various environmental policies stipulating discharge protocols exists. these policies are however not effectively executed as the industries consider them as damaging to business. the ability of industries to run with the various environmental discharge policies will sustain our natural environment. policy integration that is factoring environmental issues of concern into the core of economic development is highly important to facilitate policy performance. the main actors in environmental issues that is the industries agro firms and populace show very little understanding of the impact of their activities on the present and future environment. while organized periodical training concerning environmental sustainability should form part of environmental policy objectives ensuring that these objectives are integrated into sectors plains and policies is important. drinking water supplied to our communities is usually sourced from rivers springs and underground sources. usually some form of treatment is carried out to ensure the water is fit for drinking although some sources are somewhat free from contaminating microorganism and can be clean for example deep well. in many developing countries one source of water can serve many uses such as drinking washing swimming bathing etc. in the same vein sewage can be channeled into water bodies. sewage can be defined as used water draining out of homes and industries that contain a wide range of debris chemicals and microorganisms. such water is regarded as potential health hazard to consumers or the users of other sort. a major kind of hazard is the presence of pathogenic organisms in such water. this is why water is usually treated in three phases. the first is to separate large matter in the water source and the second stage focuses on removing more toxic substances and other matter. the tertiary phase involves total purification of water commonly by chemical disinfection. more recently membrane bioreactors are being used and have been found to be very efficient in removing contaminants. these are combinations of communities and high efficiency membranes that are much more effective at removing contaminants. the role of microbes is obvious in the second stage where microorganisms actively carry out biodegradation of organic matter in the aqueous portion produced after the first stage. biodegradation of materials such as paper and petroleum are by bacteria algae and protozoa. when water is exposed to air soil as well as effluents it gains saprobic microorganisms it can also pick up pathogens such as cryptosporidium campylobacter salmonella shigella etc. to monitor water for each of these pathogens may not be possible but detection of fecal contamination is an easier way of spotting contamination. in such case when the fecal contamination is high pathogens are believed to be present and the water is unsafe for drinking. hence indicator organisms are used as tools to detect fecal contamination of water. they usually inhabit the intestine of mammals and birds and can be easily identified using common laboratory procedures. to achieve water protection it will be almost impossible to search for the pathogens themselves. hence certain organisms with specified criteria are used as indicators of the presence of enteric pathogens in a water sample. an indicator bacterium should be applicable for analysis of all types of water it should be found anytime enteric pathogens are present and it should thrive in the wastewater longer than the toughest enteric pathogen. in addition such organism should not reproduce in the contaminated water because this will give exaggerated values and it should not be harmful to human begins. other criteria are that the level of contamination should be directly proportional to the level of fecal contamination assay procedure for the indicator organism should be highly specific and the test procedure should be easily performed. the following are commonly used as indicators of fecal contamination in water total coliforms escherichia coli fecal coliforms fecal streptococci enterococci coliphage and clostridium perfringens. coliforms are members of the family enterobacteriaceae. they are facultative anaerobic gram negative nonsporing rod shaped bacteria that ferment lactose with gas formation within hours at. microbial contamination of water can be detected by checking for certain organisms including heterotrophic bacteria coliforms and escherichia coli in such samples. the work by kora et al. showed that heterotrophic bacteria were in abundance in the lake water sampled. they also reported that contamination by e. coli and coliforms were beyond the allowable limit indiscriminate disposal of sewage into water as well as release of human excreta was implicated in the high level of indicator organisms. control of pathogens in water is important to prevent waterborne diseases this can be effectively done using multiple barrier approach. microbial treatment methods goes further than traditional municipal wastewater treatment because it takes into consideration the removal of nutrients and easily degradable organic compounds as well as the possible presence of toxic compounds and variations in ph of the wastewater. a more advanced design is required in the bioreactor to be used. some parameters to be considered in designing a treatment system are biomass yield nutrient addition the supply of oxygen or other electron donor ph control as well as kinetics that is biological reaction rates. it is important to note at high concentration many compounds of interest are toxic to bacteria being used for treatment. also some dissolved organic and inorganic compounds may constitute inhibitors to biodegradation by the organism. biological treatment processes may not consist of the followinglagoon treatment activated sludge as well as fixed film bioreactors. the lagoon treatment is long detention time basins but unlike activated sludge processes they do not use solid recycle. such treatment scheme may be in three categories anaerobic lagoon treatment which makes use of highly loaded lakes creating anaerobic conditions. it has been used successfully for the pretreatment of meat and poultry processing wastewater reducing the biochemical oxygen demand considerably. in the case of facultative ponds there is an aerobic surface and an anaerobic bottom. the top aerobic layer facilitates treatment of dissolved organic compounds as well as odourous compounds. this has found application in pulp and paper industries. with regards to aerated lagoons oxygen is provided by mechanical means or diffused aeration and the solids are continuously mixed and in suspension. biological oxygen demand removal may range up to. another biological treatment process of interest is the activated sludge. it is made up of an aeration basin where aeration equipment provides both oxygen and adequate mixing of wastewater to maintain a uniformly mixed liquor suspended solids. the aeration basin is followed by a liquidsolid separation usually in a clarifier by gravity and finally the settled biomass is returned again to the activated sludge basin. examples of aeration basin configurations are plug flow systems single completely mixed basins and basins in series. the solid retention time is important in this treatment process. the solid retention time is the average time biomass is maintained in a biological treatment process reaction. generally srt control is temperature dependent and for a warmer climate srt should be between and days. the clarifier is very important in the performance of activated sludge processes. it ensures that efficient clarification and thickening of mixed liquor occurs. when the readily degradable soluble biochemical oxygen demand is high in wastewaters growth of filamentous bacteria is encouraged leading to poor sludge settlement. the use of powdered activated carbon has been discovered to enhance the efficiency of activated sludge processes. the pac functions by adsorbing inhibitory chemicals or adsorbing chemicals that buffer variable loads. the application between and mg liter of wastewater has been proven to remove organic inhibitors of the process as well as improve nitrification since it absorbs organic compounds that can prevent this process in autotrophic bacteria. apart from the aforementioned anaerobic bioreactors are also beneficial for the industrial wastewater treatment. this is because it is cost effective and can be used for industrial wastewater with high strength. the processes in the anaerobic bioreactor lead to the production of mainly methane as well as other gases. however there is a need to strike a balance between fermentation bacterial activity and methanogenic bacteria activity as the latter is slow growing. advantages of anaerobic treatment include low sludge formation production of useful product low nutrient requirement and more importantly less energy requirements since aeration is not necessary. in addition to the energy production advantages of anaerobic wastewater treatment high organic matter removal efficiency low excess sludge production and stable operation are characteristics of this wastewater treatment technique. a most recent advancement in the biological treatment of wastewater is the use of membranes in bioreactors. in such cases the membrane can serve three major purposes. firstly membranes can be used as a surface for the attachment for growth of organisms and to permit oxygen to permeate into the biofilm. an example of this is the hollow fiber gas permeable membranes in wastewater treatment. such membrane is produced from microporous hydrophobic polypropylene and allows almost oxygen transfer while ensuring high biomass density within the space. the second way membranes can be used as selective barriers. such membranes permit organic compounds in wastewater to permeate but do not transport ions into the bioreactor. thus it allows for the selection of biodegradable organic compounds. an example of a material used for such membrane is silicone rubber. finally membranes can be for biomass separation. this third category requires that the membrane be used instead of a clarifier after activated sludge treatment. when such membranes are used the effluent produced is of high quality and less sludge. in addition automated processing can be easily employed. the disadvantage however is the financial enormity of the investment for initial start up as well as maintenance. since coliform bacteria are often detected in drinking water and often the source of contamination is not known it is important to put in place control measures. the water distribution systems must be considered because water quality deterioration may occur. this can be as a result of reduced maintenance of the distribution system or from insufficient treatment and may lead to undue microbial growth which the consumer may not notice. water distribution systems should be periodically flushed to remove sediments deposits as well as the growth of microorganisms within the pipe. for areas where the flow rate is low and possibly of the water becoming stale is high a secondary disinfection using monochloramine and proper maintenance should be carried out in such as to prevent nitrification. another point is to avoid a break in the distribution system especially during construction repairs or installations and cross connections. the officers should also ensure that the level of treatment a water sample is given is in conformity with the quality of the source of water. also the sampling for laboratory analysis must also be taken into consideration and monitored thoroughly when aseptic techniques are compromised detection of coliforms may occur. even though reports of water diseases have been low and less serious in most developed countries it is still a major concern in some underdeveloped countries especially war ravaged countries. it is however important to operate a multibarrier approach which will ensure protection of the water source and also certify adequate treatment and distribution of water. it is however important that every occurrence of coliforms in drinking water be properly investigated so that if the contamination is as a result of operational deficiency this can be addressed and future occurrence is prevented thus safe guarding the health of the public. several modern methods of water purification have been well embraced in our society today. however some rural dwellers who may not be able to afford these modern treatment methods still have water pollution as a major challenge. furthermore the disinfection by products which remain after treatment is another reason why herbal attempts in water treatment should be encouraged. it is important to note that not many researchers apply their antimicrobial extract or fractions directly in water treatment. many groups stop at establishing the antimicrobial potential of their study plant whereas others go further to apply the extracts in water treatment. for instance a reported work used alcoholic aqueous and fresh juice extracts of ocimum sanctum and azadirachta indica and applied them in vitro against salmonella which was chosen as an indicator organism. the alcoholic extract gave the best result for well water whereas the aqueous extract was best for lake water. similarly inspired by the fact that tulsi neem and amla are used to treat microbial infection without any side effect another researcher compared the effectiveness of these three herbs in water purification using percentage of e. coli removal to measure the effectiveness of each herb. a notable observation is the fact that a mixture of concentration of each herb is not as efficient as the synergistic combination of the three. an indirect application of herbs in water purification is their use in the synthesis of nanoparticles which are afterwards applied to remove contaminants from water. these extracts influence the surface properties of the nanoparticles thus dictating their unique properties owing to the obvious advantages of natural disinfection there is a need for more research into natural products for water purification. this will in no small way help rural dwellers to cheaply assess cheap clean water and so live a healthier lifestyle. all organisms including man need water for their survival. water resource managers had strongly depended on wastewater treatment in ensuring that the quality of water is sustained preserved and maintained for optimal use. by an estimated around billion people out of a total population of around billion will be living in areas of water stress. one of the major environmental issues affecting humanity is the increasing worldwide contamination of freshwater systems as a consequence of industrial and chemical compound materials being emptied into their pathways runways majorly in form of micro pollutants. according to schwarzenbach et al. most of these pollutants are present at low concentrations many of them however can raise significant toxicological concerns more importantly when such compounds are present as constituents of composite blends. numerous micro pollutants had been identified in literatures which are not vulnerable to current treatment and are subsequently transported to the aquatic environment. some of these include steroid hormones pesticides industrial chemicals pharmaceuticals and many other emerging materials. this consequently endangers both the aquatic and human life. it is therefore not surprising that freshwater pollution is a strong public menace which requires global concern. the next quotation properly situates the environmental risk humans are exposed to it is in the interest of all the world that climatic changes are understood and that the risks of irreversible damage to natural systems and the threats to the very survival of man be evaluated and allayed with the greatest urgency the above quotation were the statements of the president of the republic of the maldives his excellency maumoon abdul gayoom during the united nations general assembly held in in the united states of america as adapted from the. the meeting was centered on issues of environment and development. due to climate change effect both the thermal and hydrological phases of rivers are expected to vary. owning to these it is necessary to briefly discuss what climate change is as climate change has the potential of imposing additional pressures in some regions of the world. in other to get a good grasp of what climate change is it may be better to first define climate. climate is usually narrowly defined as the average weather or broadly as the statistical description in terms of the average and variability of relevant parameters or quantities of interest over a period of time ranging from days to millions of years. most often the parameters often used are temperature precipitation wind etc. climate can therefore be generally described as a state including statistical description of the climate system. climate change on the other hand often referred to as global warming is the rise in the average temperature on the earth s surface. it is well believed that the climate change event is as a consequence of human use of fossil fuels which consequently releases carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the air. these gases trap heat within the earth s atmosphere and can have a variety of effects ranging from rising sea levels to severe weather events. green et al. had submitted that global climate change can include natural and anthropogenic influences on terrestrial climate and the hydrologic cycle. most notable international scientific community had actualized the reality of climate change. some of these include the national aeronautics and space administration the national oceanic and atmospheric administration and the environmental protection agency of the united states to mention a few. these agencies further reiterated that climate change is a menace created from human activity to affect human. figure adapted from world health organization geneva report revealed that all the major activities of global climatic changes eventually bore its consequence on human in general and on human health in particular. inter relationship between various kinds of environmental change. adapted from who geneva report. however pressures and anxiety on the earth s climatic system are having impacts on the surface of the earth. apart from the rising surface temperatures the activities of increasing and frequent flooding and droughts and the changes in our natural water ecosystem are other areas of great concern in the continuous existence of man on earth. according to who geneva report climatic situation and activities affect human well being both directly and indirectly. the direct influence is through the physical effects of climatic extremes whereas the indirect means include the influence on the intensities or level of pollution in the air on the marine and freshwater systems that provide food and water as well as the pathogens that cause infectious diseases. for the purpose of this section we concentrate on the climatic activities with respect to water pollution. this will lead us to the next sub section. observational records and climate projections provide abundant evidence that freshwater resources are vulnerable and have the potential to be strongly impacted by climate change with wide ranging consequences for human societies and ecosystems excerpt from the executive summary of the technical paper of the ipcc edited by bates et al. human activity affects weather climate and the environment. while some of human activities are harmless others damage the environment. while the environment can absorb some abuse without long term effects much harmful human activity exceeds the environment s capacity to recover. water pollution is one of the inevitable human induced climate change issues that called for urgent remedial measures. water pollution will in no small measure affect or alter the basic water quality parameters comprising the micro pollutants physiochemical and biological parameters. probable and incessant changes in both rainfall and air temperature has the capacity to affect river flow thereby inducing chemical reaction kinetics as well as drop in the freshwater ecological quality. associated with such process are dilution of contaminants and water sediment loads which when ran into lakes will alter its natural features and affect its inhabitants. this form of water pollution or through man made toxic chemical or and by products addition may therefore generate some toxic and greenhouse gases which may subsequently contribute to global warming activities or more severe environmental threats. the greenhouse gases are the gaseous constituents of the atmosphere which can absorb and emit radiation at certain wavelengths within the spectrum of thermal infrared radiation emitted by the earth s surface the atmosphere itself and the clouds. the primary greenhouse gases in the earth s atmosphere include carbon dioxide nitrous oxide water vapor methane and ozone. the other ones identified from the kyoto protocol include hydrofluorocarbons perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride. some of these environmental threats include earth s temperature enhancement lowering of atmospheric air quality and killing of aquatic animals. consequently given the legacy of historic greenhouse gas emissions and the prospect of inevitable climate change one can not but commit significant financial and technical resources to remediating the effect through rigorous research efforts and sensitization activities more importantly to water pollution and water related issues. thus water resources managers are continuously and increasingly looking for information on the possible changes in hydrological regimes which may arise in the next few decades for likeable adaptation measure plan. an interesting challenge is that while incessant water pollution may bring about a change in climatic conditions through greenhouse effect and activities the climate too will in turn take its toll effect on the water system and environment. this is because the higher temperature generated from the greenhouse effect will eventually turn some part of the snowfall into rainfall causing an earlier snowmelt season. these effects will consequently alter the timing and volume of spring flood appreciably. the rise in sea level during this time will then cause saline water intrusion into groundwater aquifers close to the coast thereby reducing the available groundwater resources. this process will in no small measure affect humans as almost about of the world population depends on groundwater for their various activities. mitchelle et al. using physically hydrological and water temperature modeling framework had reported an increase in the seasonality of river discharge for about of the global land coverage for the projected and modeled data for years when compared with the years spanning. they also projected a rise in temperaturerevealing a projected global change into the future. other effects of climate change on the hydrological cycle include increasing atmospheric water vapor content changes in soil moisture and runoff and changing precipitation patterns. furthermore higher temperatures of freshwater and changes in extremes including floods and droughts can also intensify many forms of water pollution. the authors also showed that water fluctuation in quantity and quality has the potential of affecting food stability and availabilityleading to a reduction in food security to vulnerable poor farmers. almost of the entire population of the earth do not have adequate access to safe water while about suffer the effects of deplorable sanitary situations. schwarzenbach et al. had submitted that the increase in surface groundwater pollution will go a long way in affecting both the human and aquatic life systems. according to schwarzenbach et al. about of the earth s available and renewable freshwater are used for industrial domestic and agricultural purposes. however if this activities are not well managed water pollution may be inevitable with different kinds of pollutants. some of the water pollutants according to the authors include industrial chemicals biocides natural chemicals industrial products as well as consumer products. industrial manufactured nanomaterials had also been found to be a major water pollutant whose effects is on the increase in affecting aquatic ecosystem. according to lapworth et al. groundwater pollution mainly results from landfill leachate infiltration of contaminated water from agricultural land groundwater surface water reaction as well as seepage of sewer systems. while some of these pollutants like heavy metals are not degraded at all some others disintegrated very slowly and can be transported to hundreds of kilometers away from the source. the effects of their waterborne pollution however ranges from contamination of drinking water causing drinking water quality problems to emission of greenhouse gases resulting in climatic change challenges. some remediate climate change mitigation measures against water pollution can however be taken. some of these include carbon dioxide capture and storage planting of bio energy crops proper solid waste disposition afforestation or reforestation cropland managementboth for water and reduced tillage among other measures. scientific researches involving water pollution should be geared more toward ascertaining the physical underlying molecular mechanisms and factors rather than just the usual empirical comparison approach that is commonly used. the mechanisms involved if well understood will go a long way in properly situating ways of combating the water pollution challenges. this according to metz and ingold may be achieved by developing a structure that addresses both the problem dimension and sustainability dimension of assessing best instruments that regulate water pollution. a sustainable working policy on water pollution should not only be designed and enacted but also rigorously followed more importantly in the developing and underdeveloped countries where the menace of water pollution has not been effectively managed. bemelmans videc had presented a classification for effectively managing water pollution. these are regulation economic instruments and information. these bemelmans videc classifications according to metz would help in differentiating source directed measures from end of pipe measures in water quality regulation. while the source directed measures help in avoiding pollution before toxic and injurious chemical materials enter into waters the end of pipe measures concentrate on filtering pollution after its input into wastewater. furthermore usage and disposal approaches should be in place with the aim of minimizing the addition of critical pollutants into aquatic environment. in addition such system specific properties and reactivities should be well understood and quantified. this kind of processes will yield a significant framework for reliable coverage and evaluation of chemical compounds in complex macroscopic ecosystems. other alternative methods for removing pollutants from waters include ozonation and advanced oxidation process coagulation flocculation membrane bioreactor pac and attached growth treatment processes. refer to the work of for comprehensive reading on the methodology and activity of each process. it can therefore be concluded that whatever form of measure taken in inhibiting both surface and groundwater will not only advance our aquatic ecosystem but will also help man from further endangering his environment from the menace of climate change. since water forms a core of the existence of human and other living things its preservation and sustainable availability can not be overemphasized. the availability of clean water is greatly threatened by various human activities and of interest is pollution which in turn affects the ecosystem and causes various climatic changes. while various wastewater treatment methods are being explored by industries and various treatment plants untreated wastewater is still being discharged into the water bodies by some industries. thus effective environmental protection policies compliance drive will be of immense benefit to the environment and by extension to human. factoring these environmental protection policies into the goals and objectives of various actors involved in environmental deterioration will help policies performance. this will serve as a step forward in the direction of ameliorating water pollution. the author. licensee intechopen. this chapter is distributed under the terms of the creative commons attribution. license which permits unrestricted use

poor access to this much needed asset. although there are water treatment processes such as drinking water treatment or desalination that facilitate its treatment use and consumption in areas with quality or supply problems it is first necessary to avoid its contamination. in this video we show you what are the main causes and effects of water pollution. humans are the main cause of water pollution which is triggered in many ways by the dumping of industrial waste due to temperature rise that cause the alteration of water by reducing the oxygen in its composition or due to deforestation which causes sediments and bacteria to appear under the soil and therefore contaminate groundwater. in the same way the pesticides used in agricultural fields filter through underground channels and reach the consumption networks and also as a result of accidental spillage of oil. what are the main consequences of water pollution firstly the disappearance of biodiversity and aquatic ecosystems. also humans are harmed by the alteration in the food chain and by contracting illnesses when drinking or using contaminated water. as you can see water pollution has a great impact in the environment. for all this we must ensure water availability its sustainable management and sanitation for all as reflected in the sixth of the sustainable development goals adopted by the united nations in the agenda. neil kaushik i want see on water pollution causes preventions consequences digarmexamplesvibha v menon itwasawesome. marissa m i love this so damn muchalistair gill water

figure b. greenhouse gases in the atmosphere including water vapour carbon dioxide methane and nitrous oxide absorb heat energy and emit it in all directions keeping earth s surface and lower atmosphere warm. adding more greenhouse gases to the atmosphere enhances the effect making earth s surface and lower atmosphere even warmer. image based on a figure from us epa. the sun serves as the primary energy source for earth s climate. some of the incoming sunlight is reflected directly back into space especially by bright surfaces such as ice and clouds and the rest is absorbed by the surface and the atmosphere. much of this absorbed solar energy is re emitted as heat. the atmosphere in turn absorbs and re radiates heat some of which escapes to space. any disturbance to this balance of incoming and outgoing energy will affect the climate. for example small changes in the output of energy from the sun will affect this balance directly. if all heat energy emitted from the surface passed through the atmosphere directly into space earth s average surface temperature would be tens of degrees colder than today. greenhouse gases in the atmosphere including water vapour carbon dioxide methane and nitrous oxide act to make the surface much warmer than this because they absorb and emit heat energy in all directions keeping earth s surface and lower atmosphere warm. without this greenhouse effect life as we know it could not have evolved on our planet. adding more greenhouse gases to the atmosphere makes it even more effective at preventing heat from escaping into space. when the energy leaving is less than the energy entering earth warms until a new balance is established. greenhouse gases emitted by human activities alter earth s energy balance and thus its climate. humans also affect climate by changing the nature of the land surfaces and through the emission of pollutants that affect the amount and type of particles in the atmosphere. scientists have determined that when all human and natural factors are considered earth s climate balance has been altered towards warming with the biggest contributor being increases in co. figure b. measurements of atmospheric co since from the mauna loa observatory in hawaii and from the south pole show a steady annual increase in atmospheric co concentration. the small up and down saw tooth pattern reflects seasonal changes in the release and uptake of co by plants. source scripps co program the atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide methane and nitrous oxide have increased significantly since the industrial revolution began. in the case of carbon dioxide the average concentration measured at the mauna loa observatory in hawaii has risen from parts per million in to ppm in. the same rates of increase have since been recorded at numerous other stations worldwide. since pre industrial times the atmospheric concentration of co has increased by methane has increased by about and nitrous oxide has increased by roughly. more than half of the increase in co has occurred since. increases in all three gases contribute to warming of earth with the increase in co playing the largest role. learn about the sources of human emitted greenhouse gases. figure b. co variations during the past years obtained from analysis of air trapped in an ice core extracted from antarctica show a sharp rise in atmospheric co starting in the late century. modern atmospheric measurements from mauna loa are superimposed in blue. source figure by eric wolff data from etheridge et al. macfarling meure et al.. scientists have examined greenhouse gases in the context of the past. analysis of air trapped inside ice that has been accumulating over time in antarctica shows that the co concentration began to increase significantly in the century after staying in the range of to ppm for the previous years. ice core records extending back years show that during that time co concentrations remained within the range of to ppm throughout many ice age cycles learn about the ice ages and no concentration above ppm is seen in ice core records until the past years. measurements of the forms of carbon in the modern atmosphere show a clear fingerprint of the addition of old carbon coming from the combustion of fossil fuels. in addition it is known that human activities currently emit an estimated billion tonnes of carbon each year mostly by burning fossil fuels which is more than enough to explain the observed increase in concentration. these and other lines of evidence point conclusively to the fact that the elevated co concentration in our atmosphere is the result of human activities. figure b. earth s global average surface temperature has risen as shown in this plot of combined land and ocean measurements from to derived from three independent analyses of the available data sets. the top panel shows annual average values from the three analyses and the bottom panel shows decadal average values including the uncertainty range for the black dataset. the temperature changes are relative to the global average surface temperature averaged from. source ipcc ar data from the hadcrut dataset uk met office hadley centre the ncdc mlost dataset us national oceanic and atmospheric administration and the nasa giss dataset us national aeronautics and space administration. estimating global average surface air temperature increase requires careful analysis of millions of measurements from around the world including from land stations ships and satellites. despite the many complications of synthesising such data multiple independent teams have concluded separately and unanimously that global average surface air temperature has risen by about. c since. although the record shows several pauses and accelerations in the increasing trend each of the last three decades has been warmer than any other decade in the instrumental record since. going further back in time before accurate thermometers were widely available temperatures can be reconstructed using climate sensitive indicators in materials such as tree rings ice cores and marine sediments. comparisons of the thermometer record with these proxy measurements suggest that the time since the early s has been the warmest year period in at least eight centuries and that global temperature is rising towards peak temperatures last seen to years ago in the warmest part of our current interglacial period. many other impacts associated with the warming trend have become evident in recent years. arctic summer sea ice cover has shrunk dramatically. the heat content of the ocean has increased. global average sea level has risen by approximately cm since due both to the expansion of warmer ocean water and to the addition of melt waters from glaciers and ice sheets on land. warming and precipitation changes are altering the geographical ranges of many plant and animal species and the timing of their life cycles. in addition to the effects on climate some of the excess co in the atmosphere is being taken up by the ocean changing its chemical composition. based just on the physics of the amount of energy that co absorbs and emits a doubling of atmospheric co concentration from pre industrial levels would by itself cause a global average temperature increase of about c. in the overall climate system however things are more complex warming leads to further effects that either amplify or diminish the initial warming. the most important feedbacks involve various forms of water. a warmer atmosphere generally contains more water vapour. water vapour is a potent greenhouse gas thus causing more warming its short lifetime in the atmosphere keeps its increase largely in step with warming. thus water vapour is treated as an amplifier and not a driver of climate change. higher temperatures in the polar regions melt sea ice and reduce seasonal snow cover exposing a darker ocean and land surface that can absorb more heat causing further warming. another important but uncertain feedback concerns changes in clouds. warming and increases in water vapour together may cause cloud cover to increase or decrease which can either amplify or dampen temperature change depending on the changes in the horizontal extent altitude and properties of clouds. the latest assessment of the science indicates that the overall net global effect of cloud changes is likely to be to amplify warming. the ocean moderates climate change. the ocean is a huge heat reservoir but it is difficult to heat its full depth because warm water tends to stay near the surface. the rate at which heat is transferred to the deep ocean is therefore slow it varies from year to year and from decade to decade and helps to determine the pace of warming at the surface. observations of the sub surface ocean are limited prior to about but since then warming of the upper m is readily apparent. there is also evidence of deeper warming. surface temperatures and rainfall in most regions vary greatly from the global average because of geographical location in particular latitude and continental position. both the average values of temperature rainfall and their extremes are also strongly affected by local patterns of winds. estimating the effects of feedback processes the pace of the warming and regional climate change requires the use of mathematical models of the atmosphere ocean land and ice built upon established laws of physics and the latest understanding of the physical chemical and biological processes affecting climate and run on powerful computers. models vary in their projections of how much additional warming to expect but all such models agree that the overall net effect of feedbacks is to amplify warming. rigorous analysis of all data and lines of evidence shows that most of the observed global warming over the past years or so can not be explained by natural causes and instead requires a significant role for the influence of human activities. in order to discern the human influence on climate scientists must consider many natural variations that affect temperature precipitation and other aspects of climate from local to global scale on timescales from days to decades and longer. one natural variation is the el nio southern oscillation an irregular alternation between warming and cooling in the equatorial pacific ocean that causes significant year to year regional and global shifts in temperature and rainfall patterns. volcanic eruptions also alter climate in part increasing the amount of small particles in the stratosphere that reflect or absorb sunlight leading to a short term surface cooling lasting typically about two to three years. over hundreds of thousands of years slow recurring variations in earth s orbit around the sun which alter the distribution of solar energy received by earth have been enough to trigger the ice age cycles of the past years. fingerprinting is a powerful way of studying the causes of climate change. different influences on climate lead to different patterns seen in climate records. this becomes obvious when scientists probe beyond changes in the average temperature of the planet and look more closely at geographical and temporal patterns of climate change. for example an increase in the sun s energy output will lead to a very different pattern of temperature change compared to that induced by an increase in co concentration. observed atmospheric temperature changes show a fingerprint much closer to that of a long term co increase than to that of a fluctuating sun alone. scientists routinely test whether purely natural changes in the sun volcanic activity or internal climate variability could plausibly explain the patterns of change they have observed in many different aspects of the climate system. these analyses have shown that the observed climate changes of the past several decades can not be explained just by natural factors. figure b. the amount and rate of warming expected for the century depends on the total amount of greenhouse gases that humankind emits. models project the temperature increase for a business as usual emissions scenario and aggressive emission reductions falling close to zero years from now. black is the modelled estimate of past warming. each solid line represents the average of different model runs using the same emissions scenario and the shaded areas provide a measure of the spread between the temperature changes projected by the different models. all data are relative to a reference period of. source ipcc ar scientists have made major advances in the observations theory and modelling of earth s climate system and these advances have enabled them to project future climate change with increasing confidence. nevertheless several major issues make it impossible to give precise estimates of how global or regional temperature trends will evolve decade by decade into the future. firstly we can not predict how much co human activities will emit as this depends on factors such as how the global economy develops and how society s production and consumption of energy changes in the coming decades. secondly with current understanding of the complexities of how climate feedbacks operate there is a range of possible outcomes even for a particular scenario of co emissions. finally over timescales of a decade or so natural variability can modulate the effects of an underlying trend in temperature. taken together all model projections indicate that earth will continue to warm considerably more over the next few decades to centuries. if there were no technological or policy changes to reduce emission trends from their current trajectory then further warming of. to. c in addition to that which has already occurred would be expected during the century. projecting what those ranges will mean for the climate experienced at any particular location is a challenging scientific problem but estimates are continuing to improve as regional and local scale models advance. share
